						"The Mercury lamp was the first kind of metal vapour light source that was mass produced for general lighting applications, and still today it remains one of the most popular discharge lamps produced globally. In Europe it has fallen out of fashion due to its relative inefficiency and rapid lumen depreciation by contrast with other light sources. However in the Americas and Asian countries its low system cost, long life and high colour temperature continue to make it a desirable light source for exterior illumination. Figure 1 illustrates the construction of a typical modern High Pressure Mercury lamp.",
						"At the heart of the lamp is an arc tube which is fabricated from quartz, with a tungsten electrode disposed at either end. The tube contains a few milligrams of mercury and around 25-50 torr of pure argon as a buffer gas to carry the discharge while the lamp warms up, producing heat to vaporise the mercury and bring it into the discharge.",
						"An auxiliary starting electrode is placed next to one of the main electrodes to facilitate lamp ignition. When the lamp is first energised the full open circuit voltage is applied across the arc tube. The distance between the electrodes is so large that the resulting voltage gradient is not high enough to cause ionisation of the gas filling. However the same voltage is also applied between one electrode and the auxiliary via a small resistor. The gap between these electrodes is much smaller, and the voltage gradient is sufficiently high that ionisation will occur. A small discharge strikes, the series resistor of 10-30kW limiting the current flow to about one thousandth of the normal lamp current. Once free electrons, ions and photons have been produced in the arc tube it is then very easy to strike a discharge across the main electrodes. The discharge quickly makes this transition because it can then bypass the starting resistor, and there is no electrical resistance between the main electrodes. Some lamps, particularly high wattage types often include two auxiliary electrodes, one beside each main electrode and connected via a resistor to  the opposite end of the arc tube. This is also standard practice in mercury lamps designed for use in colder atmospheres.",
						"Once the lamp has warmed up and the mercury is fully vaporised, the discharge operates in unsaturated mercury vapour at a pressure varying from 18 bar for the smallest types, to 2 bar for the largest. The arc emits the characteristic green, yellow and violet mercury lines and there there are also considerable amounts of invisible long-wave ultra violet  at 365nm along with a broad range of shorter wavelengths. In the earliest lamps having clear outer bulbs this invisible UV radiation was completely wasted. Today the outer bulb is internally coated with a thin layer of a fluorescent phosphor which converts the UV into visible light, generally at the red end of the spectrum where the mercury output is lacking, to improve the colour rendering properties of this light source.",
						"The outer envelope is filled with a nitrogen or argon-nitrogen mixture, or occasionally with carbon dioxide, both to prevent oxidation of the arc tube seals and to slow the rate of deterioration of certain phosphors. For low power lamps of 50 Watts and below, a vacuum or argon-rich atmosphere is employed by some manufacturers as it affords better thermal insulation, minimising conducted and convected heat losses which can become significant for such small arc tubes, and allowing them to run up to full intensity more quickly. Vacuum or at least reduced gas pressures are also employed in a special range of lamps designed for use in extremely cold atmospheres - again the object here is to provide better thermal insulation which allows the arc tube to warm up more rapidly. Heat-reflective coatings of platinum or gold are often also applied behind the electrodes of small or cold atmosphere lamps again to minimise heat losses and help them run up more rapidly.",
						"By comparison with other common discharge lamps, mercury vapour sources have the lowest luminous efficacy. But during their 100-years of development, numerous changes in materials have taken place to ensure that a gain in performance has occurred every few years right up to the 1980's, when all further development for general lighting lamps effectively ceased. In 2003 however, a significant performance increase was made with the introduction of Philips' new HPL-4 lamp in Europe.",
						"The technological progress in terms of luminous efficacy is compared with other light sources in Figure 2 below. Lumens per watt are only one aspect of lamp performance though, and mercury lamps do have other advantages to offer - principally their colour rendering properties are considerably better than most sodium products, and an extremely low system cost arising from the simple lamp design and basic control gear requirements secures them a market even in some of today's new installations."

						"The luminous efficacy of the mercury discharge is directly related to the vapour pressure at which it operates, and Figure 3 below details the precise relationship for one particular design of lamp. The first  lamps operated at a relatively low pressure of less than one torr and had an efficacy of 17.9 lm/W, just to the right of point B on the graph below, so it is obvious that there was considerable room for improvements in efficacy.",
						"The data here relates to a tube of 27mm diameter with the discharge current being held constant at 4 Amperes (Krefft &amp; Summerer, 1934). For each lamp the precise values will be slightly different, but the general principles are illustrated here.",
						"At the lowest pressure indicated on the graph above (point A), the majority of the mercury radiation is in the ultra-violet part of the spectrum. The temperature of the discharge is low and not a great deal higher than the tube wall, thus with such a small temperature gradient the loss of energy by thermal conduction is minimal and this ultra-violet generation is very efficient. However, the lack of radiation in the visible part of the spectrum means that lamps operating in this pressure region attain an efficacy of only some 10 lm/W.",
						"As pressure increases, so does the luminous efficacy and it reaches a maximum at 0.1 torr (point B) where approximately 20 lm/W can be attained. The reason for the increase is that self-absorption of the mercury resonance lines in the ultra-violet part of the spectrum begins to become significant, with the effect that the relative intensity of other lines in the visible part of the spectrum increases, hence luminous efficacy  rises.",
						"Although such an inefficient discharge might at first seem to be particularly useless for lighting applications (even incandescent lamps can do better!), it should be remembered that fluorescent phosphors can be used to convert invisible ultra violet radiation into useful light. This is the principle of operation in the fluorescent tube in which a discharge  generating the maximum amount of ultra-violet is highly desirable, so the typical mercury vapour pressure is around 0.005 torr. At such a pressure, the efficacy of generating the 253.7nm ultra-violet resonance line is at its maximum. However in this text, only the higher pressure mercury discharges are of interest and detailed information on the fluorescent lamp will be found under that category.",
						"Above 0.1 torr the luminous efficacy (and UV generation) begins to fall again. The reason here is that with increasing pressure, there are more mercury atoms in the tube and the probability of energy being lost due to elastic collisions between a speeding electron and a mercury atom increases. See Figure 4. With more mercury atoms in the discharge tube the electrons must follow a more tortuous path from one electrode to the other, with energy being lost at each collision. Only some of these collisions are sufficiently powerful to lead to ionisation and light generation, many just result in heat losses. As pressure rises, so does this energy loss mechanism hence luminous efficacy begins to suffer. The result of more frequent collisions is that the gas temperature rises to approximately 500°C by point C. With such a hot discharge core a considerable amount of the energy input is transferred as heat by thermal conduction to the tube wall, representing a loss of energy so efficacy falls.",
						"Interestingly, a minimum is reached at point C when the pressure is about 5 torr (but depending on the tube diameter) where a fascinating phenomenon begins to occur. Above this pressure the discharge, which completely fills the entire tube diameter at lower pressures, gradually begins to contract inwards towards the axis of the tube until eventually an annular dark region exists between the discharge and the tube wall (see Figure 5). The pressure at which the discharge detatches itself from the tube wall is generally considered to be the point which differentiates the so-called low pressure lamps from all other medium or high pressure lamps.",
						"As pressure increases the discharge becomes more and more constricted, hence the dark space surrounding it also grows. This dark region affords some thermal insulation between the discharge and the tube wall, and it very conveniently reduces the significance of the conducted heat losses. Because the discharge is better insulated its temperature can rise and it soon escalates to approximately 6000°C, at which most modern mercury lamps operate. The relative intensity of the mercury lines begins to increase as the discharge contracts but without significant heat losses, the effect being that once again, luminous efficacy rises with increasing pressure.",
						"In addition by this point, the temperature at the core of the discharge has reached a level where temperature radiation begins to set in, and a small amount of continuum appears in the mercury spectrum - literally, this radiation is generated by the incandescence of heated mercury vapour. The increase in luminous efficacy beyond what was previously thought to be a minimum at C was first observed by Küch and Retschinsky in 1906.",
						"As pressure continues to rise, the extra radiation is mainly the result of the high temperature of the discharge - consequently a greater amount of continuum radiation is seen. The luminous efficacy at first rises very rapidly beyond point D, but asymptotically reaches a high value as pressures of 100,000 torr or so are reached (approximately 130 atm.) and the luminous efficacy may be as great as 70 lm/W.",
						"High pressure mercury lamps for general lighting applications operate in the pressure range above point D, typically around 4,000 to 8,000 torr (5-10 atmospheres pressure). This is the maximum attainable for a low cost general lighting lamp and is not all that far away from the maximum point shown on the graph. While the luminous efficacy at higher pressures might seem attractive, very large amounts of energy are dissipated in these lamps which require expensive constructions and forced cooling, which make them impractical for all but the most specialised applications.",
						"The spectral power distribution of the mercury discharge depends to a very great extent on the pressure at which it is operating. At low pressures the output is predominantly in the ultra-violet, but as pressure increases self-absorption here results in the visible green, yellow and violet lines becoming relatively stronger.",
						"Above about one atmosphere pressure, a very small amount of continuum radiation begins to enter the spectrum and this progressively increases in strength as pressure continues to rise. It is only just visible in the 10 atmosphere graph below as a continuous spectrum of very low intensity. The addition of wavelengths other than the principal mercury lines by this method can significantly improve the colour rendering properties of the mercury discharge.",
						"At still higher pressures in the tens of atmospheres, line broadening occurs which further enhances colour rendering quality, but the strong peaks still give an overall greenish-blue cast to the mercury spectrum. Continuum radiation can be seen to have significantly increased by this stage. However once pressure enters the region of several hundred atmospheres, the peaks begin to decrease in intensity and the light output gradually attains a more useful colour closer to white.",
						"The spectral power distribution charts in Figure 6 illustrate the changes occurring in the visible part of the mercury spectrum at various pressures. To put the significance of the ultra-violet radiation at low pressures into perspective though, the first chart is on a different scale to include the shorter wavelengths."

						"During the 1930's most of the world's countries introduced their own comprehensive systems of nomenclature to identify the many different kinds of mercury lamps which had become available. Generally these are based on logical code letter systems but in North America, lamps are assigned completely random letters to identify each type. Some of the more commonly encountered systems are disclosed in the tables below. In all cases, more than one letter may be selected from the Third Part to denote special features of the lamp."

					subhead: "Phosphors for Mercury Lamps",
					description: [
						"Since the very beginnings of mercury lighting it had been realised that a significant portion of the energy radiated by all mercury discharges is in the ultra-violet part of the spectrum.&nbsp; In the case of the low pressure discharge, more than half of the total energy supplied is radiated in the short-wave UV region at 253.7nm.&nbsp; High pressure lamps radiate about 10% of their energy in the long-wave UV region at 365.0nm, but an appreciable amount is also radiated at shorter wavelengths.&nbsp; In general lighting applications this UV is wasted since it is invisible to human eyes.&nbsp; But it was known from the outset that certain materials called phosphors exist, which are capable of fluorescing under ultra-violet radiation and generating light of other colours.&nbsp;",
						"In the mid 1930's such materials were put to use in the development of the fluorescent tube, based on converting the plentiful shortwave UV radiation from a low pressure mercury discharge into visible light.&nbsp; The phosphor coating was applied to the inside of the glass tube in which the mercury discharge took place.",
						"However the phosphors developed for the fluorescent tube are not suitable for use with higher pressure mercury lamps.&nbsp; Firstly, they are tailored to respond to shortwave UV, whereas the high pressure discharge radiates a mixture of both short and longwave UV.&nbsp; But of more importance, high pressure mercury lamps run hotter than their low pressure counterparts - the bulb wall temperature is typically of the order of 150 to 250°C.&nbsp; Rather inconveniently, the phosphors known at the time had the awkward habit of greatly losing their efficiency at such high operating temperatures.",
						"Thus it did not take long to draw up a set of requirements for new phosphors to be developed for the high pressure mercury lamp, viz: High efficiency at the elevated bulb wall temperature. Chemical stability at the high temperature and under intense UV radiation. Sensitivity to both short and long wave UV from the arc tube. Light absorption to be as little as possible. Ideally, the phosphor should emit red light for colour-correction. Overall light generation should be white, not too far from the blackbody locus",
						"In the early days, some phosphors were discovered which could match one or two of the above criteria, but not all of them!&nbsp; Thus mercury fluorescent lamps could be had in two main types - colour-corrected types where the phosphor contributed a small amount of red light to the spectrum, or high efficacy types where the phosphor contributed a much larger quantity of blue or green light.&nbsp; It was not until the late 1960's that the problem was satisfactorily solved and a new phosphor satisfying all of the above requirements was developed.&nbsp; The following pages in this section chart the development of the five principal families of phosphors which have been employed in mercury lamps.",
						"Before considering each phosphor in detail, it will be helpful to introduce some of the basic principles governing their properties and performance.&nbsp; One of the most fundamental laws which applies to nearly all luminescent solids, is that the wavelength of the emitted radiation is always longer than that of the absorbed radiation.&nbsp; For instance, short-wave UV can be converted into light of any colour, since the wavelength of each colour of light is much longer than UV.&nbsp; Short-wave blue light can similarly be down-converted into longer wavelength red light.&nbsp; But long-wave red light cannot be converted back up to short-wave blue light (except under exceptional circumstances).&nbsp; This general principle which virtually all phosphors follow is called Stokes' Law.",
						"Incidentally when the names of the various phosphors are introduced throughout this section, it will be noticed that they nearly always consist of the host material plus a so-called activator.&nbsp; The activator is generally a minute trace of impurity and curiously, it is generally the activator which determines the wavelength of light emission from each phosphor.&nbsp; When the names are the phosphors are written it is standard practice to write the chemical symbol of the activator after the formula of the host material.&nbsp; For instance, zinc sulphide activated with manganese is written as ZnS : Mn."

						"The first application of a phosphor coating to the outer bulb of a mercury lamp was performed in England, and was the development of the  GEC Hirst Research Centre in Wembley.&nbsp; This was most appropriate in view of the fact that the same laboratory created both the earliest fluorescent tubes and the first practical high pressure mercury lamp just a few years earlier.&nbsp;  The goal of the development was to find a phosphor which could generate some reddish colour light to complement the predominately blue-green light of the mercury discharge, thereby increasing its colour rendering properties.",
						"The year was 1937, and the first lamp to receive the new phosphor treatment was the biggest seller of the day - the 400W MA medium-pressure source with a hard glass arc tube.&nbsp; The luminescent material was zinc cadmium sulphide with a copper impurity as the activator, (Zn,Cd)S: Cu. This type of coating is sensitive to the longwave UV which escapes from MA arc tubes in copious quantities. It efficiently down-converts this UV to an orange-red colour, the precise wavelength depending on both the Zn to Cd ratio and the physical temperature of the bulb wall onto which the fluorescent layer is applied.&nbsp; The development resulted in the so-called MAF lamp, the additional letter F signifying the use of a fluorescent bulb.&nbsp; A typical Osram 400W MAF lamp is shown alongside the clear MA lamp to the right.",
						"It will at once be noticed that the shape of this lamp is very different than the conventional slim tubular outer bulb of normal MA lamps.&nbsp; It was necessary to increase bulb diameter from 51mm to 165mm simply to ensure that the phosphor was sufficiently far removed from the arc tube that its temperature was low enough to allow it to function correctly.&nbsp;",
						"The first lamps had a cylindrical shape, but it was very quickly modified to the  conical isothermal form which is illustrated both above and to the left.&nbsp; The shape of the isothermal bulb matches the temperature distribution of the 400W MA arc tube when run in the cap up position, and the efficacy of the lamp was raised slightly by this approach which ensured that the phosphor temperature was as uniform as possible over the greater part of the bulb surface area.&nbsp; In practice its temperature was maintained fairly accurately in the region of 100-150°C by this method, the precise thermal distribution being revealed in Figure XX.",
						"It is interesting to note that despite the extra orange emission of the phosphor, the total luminous flux of the new fluorescent lamps was no greater than for clear types.&nbsp; Firstly the phosphors radiated at the red end of the spectrum, where the sensitivity of the human eye is so low as to deprive the additional light of any significant importance in its contribution to luminous flux.&nbsp; But secondly, the coating also absorbed about as much visible light from the arc tube as it generated from UV down-conversion, effectively nullifying the gain.&nbsp; It's quantum efficiency was fairly low by present day standards, achieving 50% efficiency in converting the 365nm longwave mercury line into visible light, but only 25% efficiency at the shorter 253.7nm wavelength.",
						"The new coating was very valuable in that it boosted the red ratio from 1% to around 4%, a particularly important increase - the spectral power distribution of the phosphor used in these first lamps can be seen in Figure XX.&nbsp; However the chosen material had such a high cadmium content that it showed a natural yellowish colouration.&nbsp; Consequently its transmission of visible light was rather low, its yellowish hue indicating that it was a strong absorber of blue light (an extension of its UV absorption band).&nbsp; The effect  was to filter out much of the blue generated by the arc tube, thus increasing the relative intensity of the remaining green  lines.",
						"Although the orange light from the phosphor was of course very useful, the coating filtered out more blue light than the orange it generated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus the net light output was distinctly greenish and most unpleasant to work under, its spectral power distribution being shown in Figure XX.",
						"The problem was partially overcome in a new MACF lamp, which augmented the mercury charge of the arc tube with a small dose of cadmium, often a trace of zinc as well, two metals which radiate very strongly in the blue.&nbsp; The effect of this was to partially shift the colour point back towards white again by reducing the relative strength of the mercury green lines.&nbsp; The approximate spectral power distribution of the MACF lamp may be compared with the ordinary MAF and MA lamps in Figure XX.&nbsp; Cadmium makes a somewhat inefficient arc tube fill material though, and it had a strong negative impact on lamp efficacy which fell by some 12%.&nbsp; Although the fluorescent mercury-cadmium MACF lamps did deliver better colour rendering with a more pleasant overall white appearance, they were somewhat inefficient creations.&nbsp; The first coated lamps also carried a hefty price premium - costing almost twice as much as a clear lamp even in 1947, ten years after their introduction.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there proved to be a niche market for this kind of mercury lamp and they became successful in  areas where the higher purchase and operating cost could be tolerated.&nbsp; Notably, this occurred only in Europe and in particular the UK.&nbsp; Elsewhere the loss in efficacy was felt to be too significant, and the idea of a coated mercury lamp was rejected until very much later.",
						"In Europe however, developments with phosphors continued.&nbsp; The next step came in 1937 and involved the application of similar coatings to the low wattage 80W and 125W high pressure MB type lamps employing quartz arc tubes - the development this time being led by Philips in the Netherlands, with the GEC following in 1939.&nbsp; In view of the fact that the quartz arc tube operates at higher pressure and naturally generates more red light than the glass versions, the degree of required colour correction was not so great and thinner, more efficient coatings could be used.&nbsp; In addition quartz transmits the shortwave UV to which the glass arc tubes are opaque, and the presence of this radiation meant that some phosphors which were developed for the fluorescent tube could be employed, providing they had the required high-temperature stability.",
						"A new phosphor blend was thus developed for the first MBF lamps.&nbsp; It was based on a thinner layer of the same (Zn,Cd)S:Cu as used in MA lamps, augmented by a blue-luminescing component which made up for the yellowish colour of the original phosphor.&nbsp; The new component was also based on zinc sulphide but with an activator of silver instead of copper, ZnS:Ag, this substitution being responsible for the change in colour of fluorescence.&nbsp; The cadmium addition which was required in MA arc tubes could therefore be dispensed with and consequently MBF lamps were able to achieve very nearly the same luminous efficacy as the uncoated MB types.&nbsp; For every lumen which was absorbed by the coating, it re-radiated almost one lumen of orange + blue light, making it an efficient light source with rather good colour rendering  for its time.",
						"Incidentally as was the case for the MAF lamp, the size of the outer bulbs of MBF lamps also had to be increased to keep the phosphor coating cool enough for good performance.&nbsp; The new silver-activated phosphor was especially sensitive to temperature and whereas a maximum of 175°C could be tolerated in MAF lamps, 100-125°C or so was the practical limit for MBF types.&nbsp; The 80W lamps were therefore increased from 80mm to 110mm in diameter, while the 125W size grew from 90mm to 130mm.&nbsp; Traditionally these lamps had all been fitted with standard 3-pin bayonet or E27s Edison Screw caps, but from the mechanical standpoint, it was not sensible to fit such a small cap onto so large a bulb otherwise many breakages would have occurred.&nbsp; It was therefore decided to offer the inflated 125W size lamps with a large E40s Goliath Edison Screw cap for new installations.",
						"The new MBF lamps were tremendously successful in the UK, in fact so successful that evidence of the 1940's boom in low wattage mercury fluorescent lamps still remains today.&nbsp; Despite mercury lamps having now shrunk down to much more compact dimensions, today's 125W lamps are still offered with the now grossly oversized E40s large screw cap.&nbsp; Remarkably there is still a sufficiently large installed base of old 1940's luminaires to justify making new lamps with this cap type for replacement purposes!&nbsp; It is surprising that the MBF lamps were still not widely accepted outside the UK though, perhaps owing to the colour quality not being marvellous and worth the considerably higher price those lamps demanded.&nbsp; Developments in the earliest MBF lamps therefore took place most actively within the British mercury lamp manufacturers of the time - The British Thomson-Houston Co., Osram-GEC, Metropolitan Vickers, The Edison-Swan Electric Co., Siemens Bros., Philips UK and Messrs. Crompton-Parkinson."

						"The development of the mercury lamp was to take a significant turn in the late 1940's with the development of a sensational new phosphor, based on magnesium germanate activated with manganese (Mg2GeO4:Mn).&nbsp; The key feature of this material was its temperature characteristic, which made it supremely useful as a phosphor to be coated on the outer jackets of high pressure mercury lamps.&nbsp;",
						"It will be remembered that traditionally, phosphors tend to lose their efficiency as they reach higher temperatures.&nbsp; Thus the first mercury fluorescent lamps with sulphide phosphors had to be made with grossly oversized bulbs to keep the phosphor temperature as low as possible.&nbsp; Magnesium germanate, however, exhibits a peak in its efficiency when it is at a temperature of 300°C - precisely the kind of temperature at which the outer bulbs of mercury lamps operate.&nbsp; It is also stable over long periods at elevated temperatures so lamps could be made in which the phosphor maintained a high efficacy throughout life.",
						"Since 1936 it had  been known that Mg2GeO4:Mn gave a strong red fluorescence.&nbsp; The phosphor was invented by Humboldt Leverenz at the Radiophone Corporation of America (now GE's NBC Television company) and he intended it to be a more durable coating for the fluorescent screens of his company's cathode ray tubes (Leverenz, 1936).&nbsp; At the time it was a rather inefficient, but very durable generator of red light.&nbsp; Then in 1947 it was discovered that by adding an excess of MgO, phosphors could be made which were five times more efficient (Patten &amp; Williams, 1947).&nbsp; But the real breakthrough came in 1950 when Luke Thorington of Westinghouse made a further improvement which was to make the material suitably efficient as a phosphor for mercury lamps.",
						"He found that if part of the MgO (0.5 moles) in the composition                 4 MgO.GeO2:Mn was substituted with magnesium fluoride, MgF2, then the light output could be doubled yet again (Thorington, 1950).&nbsp; It is believed that the presence of fluorine results in a more thorough reaction of the components from which is phosphor is manufactured, yielding the new material magnesium fluoro-germanate, MgFGeO4:Mn.&nbsp; The combined high efficacy, thermal stability and strong red radiation peaking at  658nm saw MgFGeO4:Mn hold is place as the principal mercury lamp phosphor for nearly two decades.&nbsp; Despite the thermal stability the colour of fluorescence does shift towards orange at higher temperatures, so it is still desirable to keep the bulb wall temperature fairly low, certainly no more than 200-250°C.&nbsp; The spectral emission at typical lamp operating temperatures is shown in Figure XX.",
						"The first lamps to make use of the new phosphor were launched of course by Westinghouse, its inventor, around 1950.&nbsp; They offered a sizeable increase in the red ratio of up to 7%, nearly doubling again the red content that had been attained with earlier British developments with the sulphide phosphors.&nbsp; The spectral power distribution of a lamp made with this phosphor is illustrated in Figure XX.&nbsp; Despite the extra red luminescence, the increase in luminous flux is still almost negligible.&nbsp; Although magnesium fluoro-germanate is not nearly so strongly coloured as the earlier sulphides, it does still have a slightly off-white yellowish hint.&nbsp; The coating also has to be applied in a somewhat thicker layer than with earlier sulphides, and consequently once again, the coating absorbs as much light as the extra it generats.",
						"The slight yellowish tinge is a result of the absorption of blue light at around 420nm, once again sapping up some of the  light generated by the mercury arc, although the amount absorbed is considerably less than with earlier materials.&nbsp; Nevertheless, this blue absorption is still sufficient to impart a very slightly greenish hue to the light from  lamps bearing this coating.&nbsp; The blue absorption also increases at higher operating temperatures so despite the high temperature stability of this phosphor, it is still desirable to keep its temperature low.&nbsp; The blue absorption is sufficiently small though that for the vast majority of applications the greenish tint proved to be acceptable, in just the same way as the light from an incandescent lamp appears somewhat yellowish.",
						"This phosphor is prepared essentially from a high temperature reaction between MgO, MgF2 and GeO2 with the addition of a trace amount of the activator, Mn.&nbsp; The performance of the finished material is highly dependent on the precise firing time and temperature, as is the case for most phosphors.&nbsp; The actual time and temperature required are depending on the starting particle sizes of the raw materials, but the best phosphors in general are obtained after firing at a temperature of between 1100°C and 1200°C for  eight hours.",
						"During the firing process the grains all grow in size as the reaction proceeds.&nbsp; The higher the temperature and longer the firing time, the larger the grains will become and this is good for a high efficiency final phosphor.&nbsp; Incidentally it is also found that firing the phosphor in closed crucibles is greatly beneficial, this leading to a much coarser grain structure.&nbsp; When open crucibles are used the rate of fluorine loss is quite rapid, and since fluorine is the active agent in grain growth it is beneficial to keep its concentration high, and the closed crucibles assist greatly in this matter.",
						"The importance of the coarse large-grained structure is simple to understand.&nbsp; If the grains are large, then a relatively thick coating can be applied but the amount of light absorption within the coating is small - this is because absorption principally occurs as a result of the boundaries between one grain and the next, and if the grains are larger, then there are fewer boundaries hence light absorption will be reduced."

						"Around the same time that Luke Thorington had perfected the magnesium fluoro-germanate phosphor with Westinghouse in the USA, a remarkably similar material was brought to the attention of the Philips Laboratories in Eindhoven by a Mr. Travnicek of Graz, Austria.&nbsp; The material was magnesium arsenate activated by tetravalent manganese, 6MgO.As2O5:Mn4+, and during the previous few years Philips had built up substantial expertise in the preparation of Mn4+phosphors.&nbsp; Previously the company had pinned its hopes on a phosphor based on Magnesium titanate with the same activator, that material having a very desirable red emission but unfortunately its quantum efficiency could not be raised to levels making it suitable for use as a mercury lamp phosphor.",
						"The Eindhoven phosphor team was quickly able to adapt its titanate processes to investigate the arsenate instead, and it was this material which ultimately led to Philips' decision to bring the HPL fluorescent mercury lamp into mass production. (Incidentally in Dutch light source nomenclature, the MB lamps are known as the HP type, while their MBF fluorescent counterparts are classified as the HPL type.&nbsp; H = Hg or Mercury, P = high Pressure, L = Luminescent).",
						"The properties of this magnesium arsenate phosphor turned out to be highly favourable for its application in the company's HPL / MBF products.&nbsp; Its fluorescence is bright red peaking sharply at 656nm (Figure XX), it absorbs the whole UV emission from the mercury arc tube, its quantum efficiency is 75% for both the long and shortwave UV stimulation, and its efficiency is stable right up to 300C (Figure XX).&nbsp; Its first apparent disadvantage is that the very broad absorption of UV radiation extends slightly into the visible spectrum, and consequently some blue light is absorbed and the phopshor has a faint yellowish colouration.&nbsp; Nevertheless this is considerably less than is the case for earlier phosphors and the colour output of arsenate lamps is in no way rendered greenish.",

						"Previously Philips had made HPL lamps in only very small quantities indeed, based on the early developments in sulphide phosphors.&nbsp; But from 1950 onwards the company marketed its mercury fluorescent lamps with coatings of the arsenate phosphor which proved to be a very valuable asset.&nbsp; Other lampmakers around the world had been forced to adopt Westinghouse's magnesium fluoro-germanate material and were tied to that source, while Philips had the freedom to make lamps based on its own developments.&nbsp; The red ratio of Philips' new lamps was 7.5-9%, somewhat higher than the 7% that had been attainable with magnesium fluoro-germanate, and with germanium being a very expensive raw material the price of the Philips phosphor was also some four times cheaper.&nbsp; The thickness of the phosphor coating was chosen so as to deliver the same luminous flux from coated lamps as the clear versions.&nbsp; This could have been made thicker and allowed the phosphor to absorb all of the UV generation of the arc tube and emit more red light, but at these kinds of thicknesses blue absorption became a problem, thus shifting the colour point towards the green.",
						"In the beginning however, it was unfortunately learned that magnesium arsenate suffered a sharp decline in its efficiency during the lifetime of the HPL lamps to which it was applied, and the red ratio fell very rapidly.&nbsp; While other phosphors had to be abandoned because of their lack of durability, some ingenious thinking at Philips enabled the engineers to overcome this problem through a very simple approach.",
						"It was determined that part of the minutely small concentration of Mn4+activator had been reduced to Mn2+, this occurring because of the slightly reducing atmosphere present inside a nitrogen-filled mercury lamp outer bulb.&nbsp; Experiments were therefore conducted with new lamps containing trace amounts of oxygen in the nitrogen filling of the outer bulb, the new oxidising atmosphere theoretically being sufficient to prevent the reduction of Mn4+.&nbsp; Indeed it was subsequently proven that with 0.3% to 0.5% of oxygen in the nitrogen filling, there was no decline in the red radiation of the phosphor throughout lamp life.",
						"However, there is a reason why the outer bulbs of mercury lamps were nitrogen filled in the first place - it is because the smallest traces of oxygen are sufficient to cause oxidation of the molybdenum foil seals which carry the current through the quartz of the arc tube.&nbsp; In the oxygen doped lamps the seals would oxidise, expand, and split open the arc tubes within a matter of only some tens of hours of operation.",
						"This problem can be overcome by reducing the temperature at the outward extremities of the molybdenum foil pinch-seals simply by increasing the length of the seal.&nbsp; In fact good lamps were made this way in which the seal temperature was reduced from 500°C into a safe zone below 250°C, but such a long seal could not easily be made on automatic production equipment.&nbsp; The long-seal lamps were therefore not a viable solution to the problem.",
						"The reason for having used 0.3-0.5% of oxygen in the lamps was because during life, the various metal parts in the lamp also oxidise and bind this oxygen through getter action, and therefore enough oxygen had to be provided at the outset to last for the entire lamp life.&nbsp; It is unfortunate that the amount required was so high that it caused the seals to oxidise.&nbsp; It was as a result of this recognition that Philips devised an ingenious solution - to fill the bulb with a gas which very slowly broke down under the action of the internal UV radiation, continuously providing just enough oxygen to protect the phosphor but not so much that the seals would oxidise.&nbsp; The gas chosen was carbon dioxide.",
						"It was found that 0.5 torr filling of CO2 provided an adequate source of oxygen to protect the phosphor.&nbsp; Such a pressure is rather low though and causes the arc tubes to run somewhat hotter than usual - previously a nitrogen fill pressure of 500 torr had been used, this offering sufficiently high thermal conductivity and convection losses to maintain the arc tube at its correct temperature.&nbsp; Very fortunately it was found that increasing the CO2 pressure to similar levels had no adverse effect, and the partial pressure levels of oxygen do not rise with increasing CO2 pressure.&nbsp; The reason is because the volume CO + O2 evolved as a result of the dissociation of CO2 is roughly 50% greater than the volume of CO2 itself, hence increasing the CO2 pressure in the bulb actually results in a lower rate of dissociation and reduced oxygen partial pressure.",
						"In later work it was discovered that the reduction of the Mn4+ activator could be inhibited by replacing part of the MgO raw material with Li2O.&nbsp; This increased the UV and high temperature stability of the material and allowed the critically balanced carbon dioxide filling system to be abandoned in favour of the original and cheaper nitrogen.&nbsp; An interesting spinoff was that the incorporation of lithium also slightly changed the heights of the various emission peaks of the material.",
						"It is found that the fluorescent intensity is very strongly depending on MgO/As2O5 ratio, so much so that the composition corresponding to the orthophosphate (3MgO.As2O5:Mn4+)\n                                                                            is practically non-fluorescing.&nbsp; It is a strong UV-absorber but simply does not fluoresce.&nbsp; Increasing the MgO concentration results in an increase in fluorescent intensity up to the point where a maximum is obtained at                 6MgO.As2O5:Mn4+, the composition which was employed in all lamps.",
						"The tolerances to which this phosphor must be made are quite critical.&nbsp; Any under-dosing of MgO results in the formation of the non-fluorescent UV absorbing orthophosphate phase mentioned above, markedly decreasing the fluorescence.&nbsp; Adding an excess of MgO simply results in an excess of that compound in the finished product.&nbsp; It is not a UV absorber and therefore the rate of fall off in fluorescence is not so severe as for under-dosing, but it does still diminish due to extra scattering.",
						"During production, part of the Mg is added in the form of MgF2 which accelerates the rate of the reaction, just as is the case for magnesium fluoro-germanate.&nbsp; With that phosphor it has the effect of doubling the fluorescent intensity, but with magnesium arsenate it only has the effect of increasing the durability of the material to ensure that the phosphor does not lose its fluorescent intensity during lamp life."

						"Unlike other phosphors employed in mercury lamps, the barium-strontium-lithium silicate material developed by Osram-GEC in England fluoresces with a range of colours comprising red, orange and blue along with intermediate shades of these colours.&nbsp; It consists of a mixture of barium lithium silicate and strontium lithium silicate and by varying the proportions of each, a continuous series of solid solutions can be formed with a wide variety of luminescent properties.&nbsp; It functions in much the same way as the halophosphate group of materials which were also invented by the GEC for use in fluorescent tubes.",
						"A double activator is employed in this group.&nbsp; Trivalent cerium is the primary activator and this leads to the blue emission, but also acts to sensitise the secondary activator, manganese.&nbsp; As the manganese content is increased the intensity of the blue emission falls in favour of increased orange-red emission that is characteristic of manganese.&nbsp;",
						"If just the barium lithium silicate component is first considered, the manganese emission is rich orange, but this can be made significantly redder as strontium atoms replace barium.&nbsp; This is an important addition because when raised to the lamp operating temperature the emission shifts towards the yellow, but this can of course be minimised by starting with a higher strontium concentration.",
						"Unlike the germanate and arsenate phosphors already described, the silicate materials are almost completely snowy-white in body colour and consequently their light absorption is low, and lamp efficacy can be quite high.&nbsp; There is a UV absorption peak at 360nm, conveniently very close to the 365nm radiation of the mercury discharge, and this diminishes almost entirely to zero by 420nm, hence the very small blue absorption.&nbsp; The colour temperature of lamps made with the optimum material is typically around 4400K, the chromaticity co-ordinates being x=0.36 and y=0.38.&nbsp; It is not so far shifted towards the green as for germanate and arsenate phosphors but its colour temperature is slightly higher on account of the blue emission of the phosphor.",
						"Sulphide, Germanata and Arsenate phosphors are traditionally applied to the glass bulb as a suspension in a nitrocellulose binder, as used to be standard practice for coating tubular fluorescent lamps.&nbsp; Subsequently the coated bulbs are baked in air at 500°C to burn out the binder, but the required bake-out temperature is too high for the silicate phosphors.&nbsp; The cerium activator is oxidised in air at such high temperatures with most undesirable effects on the efficiency of the phosphor.",
						"A technique was therefore developed which allowed the lamp manufacturer to spray or dust the dry powder onto the inner surface of a bulb which had previously been wetted a film of dilute phosphoric acid.&nbsp; Following a reduced temperature bake-out at 300°C in an inert atmosphere the coating was then dried out and adhered to the bulb wall without degradation of the cerium activator.",
						"When any phosphor is applied to the bulb it is desirable that the coating should be sufficently thick that it absorbs all of the UV for conversion into visible light.&nbsp; With germanate and arsenate coatings this is not possible, because the blue absorption then becomes so high that relatively more of the mercury green line is transmitted and the lamp imparts an unpleasant greenish hue to all that it illuminates.&nbsp; Coating weight therefore has to be a compromise at about 3mg per cm2 at which there is still some blue absorption.&nbsp; With the silicate phosphors this same coating weight is sufficient to absorb all of the UV and there is no significant blue absorption.&nbsp; This is one of the primary advantages of the silicate phosphor - it may not be quite so efficient, but it allows lamps to be made which have a more natural white light emission.",
						"Just like with Philips' magnesium arsenate lamps, it was found that the red ratio of silicate lamps depreciated rather rapidly, but that once again this could be eliminated with a carbon dioxide gas filling.&nbsp; The reason for this was never determined.&nbsp; In the Philips lamps it works by providing a tiny partial pressure of oxygen which prevents the tetravalent manganese activator being reduced to the divalent species.&nbsp; However since the manganese activator starts out as divalent with the GEC silicate phosphor, the mechanism must be different.&nbsp; Furthermore an oxidising atmosphere is known to be detrimental to the primary activator of cerium and yet this does not appear to be degraded as a result of the CO2 bulb filling."

						"The orthophosphates were the last family of phosphors to be introduced before the present material yttrium vanadate came into service.&nbsp; They are all activated with tin, which must be in the divalent state to give luminescence.",
						"All tin-activated phosphors are characterised by a their very broad spectral energy emission.&nbsp; Typically they cannot achieve such a deep red emission as is possible from previously mentioned materials, but their quantum efficiency is remarkably high, as much as 87% for magnesium orthophosphate.&nbsp; They are colourless so the light transmission is high, and because the emission is at wavelengths to which the human eye is more sensitive, lamps with remarkably high luminous efficacy can be fabricated.&nbsp; They do, however, leave a lot to be desired in terms of their colour rendering properties, but from the early 1960's until the late 1980's many manufacturers offered two different kinds of mercury lamp - types with good colour rendering, and types with high efficacy at the expense of colour properties.",
						"Strontium orthophosphate, (Sr,Mg)3(PO4)2:Sn2+ modified with Mg to adjust the crystal lattice structure was the most commonly employed material in high efficacy lamps.&nbsp; Its emission peak lies at 630nm at room temperature, decreasing to shorter wavelengths quite dramatically at lamp operating temperatures but the light emission remains high.&nbsp; By 330°C the red emission peak has shifted to 570nm so it is clearly evident that colour rendering of these lamps suffers.&nbsp; While a magnesium germanate 400W lamp gives a red ratio of about 7.5%, the strontium orthophosphate lamps only manage about 5%.",
						"Similar performance was attained from calcium orthophosphate modified with Mg and this material found preference with some of the eastern European manufacturers.&nbsp; It has slightly higher efficiency again, but red ratio falls further to 4.4%, really no better than the first MAF type lamps.",
						"Meanwhile Sylvania in the USA developed materials based on calcium-zinc orthophosphates, and a particular 400W lamp attained an efficacy of 59.5lm/W.&nbsp; This was excellent by comparison with the 49lm/W attainable from red-emitting phosphors at the time, and is still impressive compared with the 55lm/W of present-day lamps with vanadate based coatings.",
						"When Vanadate coatings became available in the late 1960's though, they entirely superseded the high-efficacy line of mercury lamps in all countries except the USA, where a demand curiously continued for the old-fashioned inefficient coatings for nearly twenty years more.&nbsp; The vanadate phosphors offered 10% higher luminous efficacy and considerably enhanced colour rendering properties as well while also being pure white in colour, for the first time satisfying all of the requirements of a mercury lamp phosphor."

						"For the fluorescent material currently employed in virtually all mercury lamps still manufactured worldwide, the lighting industry is indebted to another closely related sector which also has a keen interest in phosphor development - the cathode ray tube industry.",
						"Following the boom in the production of colour televisions, a phosphor was required which gave a deeper red emitting, and more efficient red phosphor than had ever been produced before.&nbsp; It was known that Yttrium oxide with an activator of Europium met the colour and stability criteria, but there existed tremendous difficulties in the adhesion strength of this phosphor to the glass substrate, owing to the poor control over the particle sizes that could be produced with this material.",
						"A suitable alternative was invented during 1964 by Frank Palilla and Albert Levine at GTE Sylvania Laboratories in the USA, this material being Europium activated Yttrium Vanadate (Levine and Palilla, 1964). It offered equivalent performance to the oxide phosphor but without the adhesion problems.&nbsp; The technology was quickly transferred from the company's cathode ray tube division to the lamp department, where it was immediately adopted in mercury discharge lamps.",
						"The new phosphor made the former Purple stained Colour /X American lamps obsolete literally overnight, and such was the increase in performance it delivered, that within two years practically every mercury lamp plant worldwide had changed over to this new material.&nbsp; For the first time a phosphor was available which matched every single ideal requirement for mercury lamps：Strong red emission. High quantum efficiency. Sensitivity to both short and long-wave UV stimulation. Colourless, i.e. no longer was blue light absorbed by the coating. Efficient at high lamp operating temperatures. Stable throughout very long lamp lives. Despite the high cost of europium and yttrium the advantages of this phosphor were such that every customer cried out for the new colour-improved lamps, and its cost was easily justified.&nbsp;",
						"The red emission peaks of this phosphor centre at around 615-619nm, much shorter wavelengths than the former deep red 658nm peak of the germanate and arsenate materials.&nbsp; But owing to the spectral sensitivity of the human eye, this is still seen as red, and it is a wavelength to which the eye is much more sensitive.&nbsp; A combination of this effect, and the fact that the new powder coating had a much lower absorption of other wavelengths, the total luminous efficacy of vandate lamps increased by around 10% at the same time.",
						"Subsequently in later years, the problems with yttrium oxides were also overcome, and today it is an important fluorescent lamp phosphor.&nbsp; Despite its slightly lower cost, it has never become popular in mercury lamp use and all manufacturers today still continue with the vanadate material, even though the performance of both phosphors is substantially the same."

						"Although Humphry Davy demonstrated the possibility of producing light from a discharge in mercury vapour as early as 1821 by maintaining an arc between a wire and a pool of mercury, it is to the British inventor Professor J.T. Way that credit must go for the first  demonstration of a practical lamp. On September 3rd 1860 he completed an installation of modified carbon arc lamps on the Hungerford suspension bridge in London, in which the arc operated within a glass vessel containing air and a sizeable pool of mercury. The actual point of light generation in the carbon arc is the incandescence of the electrode tips, the arc itself being substantially non-radiative. But in J.T Way's lamp the heat from the discharge caused a small amount of mercury to evaporate, filling the glass chamber with its vapour, which was consequently ionised and imparted its blue-green colouration to the arc while also greatly increasing the total light output from this source.",
						"He was duly granted a British Patent for this novel extension of carbon arc lighting technology. One point worthy of mention is the method employed for starting the arc in his lamp. With the ordinary carbon arc the discharge was struck by bringing one of the electrode tips into contact with the other, and then withdrawing it slightly, the arc initiating as soon as contact was broken. This inconvenient method was surpassed in the mercury lamp, in which the upper electrode was fabricated with a small hole running along its length. To strike the arc, part of the mercury was poured through this hollow electrode, falling into contact with the lower electrode and automatically initiating the discharge once the flow finished and contact was broken. The electrodes in the lamp were stationary and as they burned away during use, complex electrical control gear would have been necessary to adjust the electrical supply as the arc gap lengthened.",
						'The health and safety issues associated with such a lamp would be horrendous today, since mercury was freely vaporised and released into the open atmosphere. Even their use outdoors would have been hazardous as a cloud of dense mercury vapour escaping from the lamps would have descended on passers by below. No other known installations of  Way\'s lamp are known, and in view of its dramatically enhanced performance this seems unusual. It is probable that even in the mid 19th century there were concerns over the possible poisonous side-effects of the lamp he developed. Certainly at this time it was becoming known that  mercury was a prominent neurotoxin, attacking the brain and spinal cord. Mercury compounds employed in the manufacture of felt, particularly favoured by hat-makers, were known for their undesirable side effects leading to premature dementia - hence the common phrase "mad as a hatter".'

						"The next milestone in mercury lamp development was laid in the summer of 1906, when there appeared in the Annalen der Physik a paper by Küch and Retschinsky concerning the production of light by a high pressure mercury discharge.",
						"Their lamp resembled a scaled-down model of the Cooper-Hewitt, but it was fabricated from quartz glass and employed two electrodes of liquid mercury. Ignition was performed by tilting the lamp so that a thread of mercury short-circuited the electrodes, the arc being started by levelling the tube and breaking the contact between the electrodes. The lamps were still DC operated. Quartz, being a much more refractory material than the hard glasses employed by Cooper-Hewitt, could endure much higher electrical loadings under which conditions the lamp efficacy rises. Such conditions naturally led to higher temperatures and higher mercury pressures as well. The inventors managed to attain pressures of several atmospheres, at which a luminous efficacy of about 50 lumens per watt was achieved. Figure 16 shows a photograph of their lamp.",
						"Although these quartz lamps were manufactured by Westinghouse (via the Cooper-Hewitt company) and later by GE, they were not practical as light sources for general lighting. The quartz envelope allowed allowed the lamp to transmit dangerously high levels of ultraviolet radiation, which incidentally developed another niche for their application - as artificial UV lamps for sun-tanning and other therapeutic uses.",
						"Additionally , and there existed no reliable method for sealing metal conductors into quartz. These early lamps employed seals in which precisely shaped conical indentations were ground into the quartz ends of the lamp, and each had to be individually tailored to mate with a tapered invar pin of identical dimensions, the whole being immersed in mercury. If the lamps didn't leak when new, they lasted only a relatively short time in service before failure of the seals brought the lamps to the end of their life.",
						"It was also required, for safety reasons, to prevent the mercury pressure rising too high under which conditions the lamp could explode. Commercially available lamps were therefore equipped with metal fins clamped to the arc tube around the mercury electrodes, serving to reduce the temperature here and keep the pressure within safe limits. They were most commonly employed in scientific or medical applications, for instance as ultra-violet sun lamps used in the treatment of various skin conditions."

						"Around the turn of the century, the first mercury lamp to become a commercial success was created by the American inventor Peter Cooper-Hewitt, Figure 8. By 1901 his development was complete and a year later he founded the Cooper-Hewitt Electric Co. of New York, backed with money from George Westinghouse.\n\t\tHis low-pressure mercury discharge radiated copious amounts of blue and green light but was severely deficient in red, and had the most appalling colour rendering ability. Despite its guaranteed ability to transform even the most beautiful human subject into a ghastly cadaverous specimen, it enjoyed remarkable success in industrial lighting. Lighting economics was the reason, and it had not gone unnoticed that for the same electricity consumption, mercury lamps put out many times more light than the carbon filaments.",
						'In 1902 the inventor stated "When it is considered that this light, when obtained with mercury gas, has an efficiency at least eight times as great as that obtained by an ordinary incandescent lamp, it will be appreciated that it has its use in places where lack of red is not important, for the economy of operation will much more than compensate for the somewhat unnatural colour given to illuminated objects"\n         Improving the colour was tackled through an early use of fluorescent materials, whereby reflectors around the lamp were given a coat of the rosy coloured dye Rhodamine. An alternative invention of Cooper-Hewitt was to employ series-wired carbon filament lamps to act as the ballast for his lamp, and these delivered a strong red contribution but did reduce  efficacy somewhat. The example illustrated in Fig. 9 is the earliest ancestor of modern mercury blended lamps.\n          The light was also prone to flickering as the root of the discharge danced around on its electrode of boiling mercury, and although the inventor fine-tuned his lamp geometry to minimise this, the problem could not be eradicated.',
						"Nevertheless the lamp enjoyed great success in industrial lighting the photo-printing business, which both required large amounts of cheap light and where colour was of little concern. Fig. 10 shows a typical 1908 advertisement aimed at the printing industry.\n        Factory lighting is a market in which it gradually lost popularity though, as a result of the tremendous advances occurring in incandescent technology. Within a decade or two the tungsten lamp had been developed to the state that it began to pose a serious threat to the sole stronghold of mercury - its previously unparalleled efficacy.",
						"The Cooper-Hewitt company embarked on a bold marketing campaign, often with rather extravagant claims that the lack of red radiation was in fact to be regarded as quite an advantage. It was stated that the fatigue of the eyes produced by close work under artificial light was due almost entirely to the presence of 'harmful red rays' in the spectrum of the incandescent lamp. The mercury lamp was subsequently promoted with renewed force in such applications as offices of draughtsmen, or in environments where close attention to books and papers is required\n        Eventually the more efficient tungsten filaments poached its place in industrial illumination, and the Cooper-Hewitt lamp was thereafter exiled to the sizeable graphic arts industry.  Its harsh blue light of high actinic value was a perfect match with the requirements of the slow emulsions used in diazo photo-printing processes of the time.  It continued as a profitable business, and encouraging results with higher pressure discharges in Europe later re-kindled the interest in mercury lamps for general lighting.\n\t\tBy 1919 the business and technology had developed to the extent that it could no longer be ignored by the giant General Electric Company of America, which bought out the Cooper-Hewitt company.  Production relocated from the original factory at 220 West 29th Street in Manhattan, and GE established its own Vapor Lamp Department at the Grand St. premises in Hoboken, New Jersey.  As new lamp types continued to be developed in Europe they were quickly adopted at GE's plant and then copied by other American manufacturers. In 1934 an improved Cooper-Hewitt lamp was developed, and it is remarkable that this continued in production at GE's plant until 1965. In the rest of the world the European style medium pressure and high pressure mercury lamps were adopted immediately, and it was only in North America that the antiquated Cooper-Hewitt lamps continued to live on for many more decades."

						"The first successful lamp consisted of a slender glass tube fabricated of the hardest borosilicate glass, containing a hefty dose of around a pound of mercury which was sealed in under very high vacuum - no gas filling was employed in the Cooper-Hewitt lamps. Initially the lamp was suitable only for operation on direct current, the anode  taking the form of a hollow iron cylinder, and the cathode being a large pool of mercury residing in a bulbous reservoir at the opposite end of the tube. The discharge length was fifty inches (1270 mm), the tube diameter one inch (25 mm), and the first model is illustrated in Figure 11.",
						"With a current of 3.5 Amps the lamp dropped 110 Volts across its length and drew a sizeable power of 385 Watts. The total light output was some 6,900 lumens when new, giving it a very desirable luminous efficacy of 17.9 lm/W. However owing to the great losses in the crude electrical control gear of the last century, the total system efficacy fell to 14.2 lm/W. Such a value was attained by gas-filled tungsten lamps of similar luminous flux in the 1920's, so it is easy to see why the Cooper-Hewitt lamp gradually lost its popularity. Its marginally longer life and superior lumen maintenance (Figure 12) helped it put up a strong fight though, and of course the high actinic value of the light ensured that it held a strong position in the photographic applications.",
						"It is of interest to note that the electrodes in this lamp underwent a continuous recycling process during operation. Of course most heat was developed at the liquid cathode which naturally evaporated. Whereas in any other discharge lamp the evaporated electrode material adheres to the bulb wall, blackening it and absorbing light, the unique liquid electrode in this lamp would continuously flow back to its home again. The  imperfect lumen maintenance record is simply attributable to the wear on the iron anode, which of course was sputtered and wore away just as in any other modern discharge lamp.",
						"The mercury cathode was necessary since the heat generated here was required to vaporise enough of the metal, however it limited the maximum mercury vapour pressure to that attained at its boiling point,  357°C. In addition the discharge temperature was low, an estimated 500°C at its core and it rapidly diminished to only 125°C at the tube wall. Cooper-Hewitt was held back by the low pressure associated with this, and limited by the glass and anode materials of his lamp. Consequently it could never enjoy the improved efficacy and colour properties that are so easily attainable with new materials at our disposal today, although in later years following the work of Küch and Retschinsky, a much more efficient quartz Cooper-Hewitt style lamp was made. Westinghouse, the original financial backers of this lamp, undertook the manufacture of quartz products from 1908 onwards and sold them as sun-tan lamps for many years. Similar European products were offered from 1910 under the names of Bastian or Spanner lamps.",
						"A great many other style lamps were also offered. Principally these took the form of the standard 50-inch glass tube being bent into a U or M shape to make it more compact, but also an AC version was developed in later years. This was essentially a modification of the Cooper-Hewitt mercury rectifier tube, consisting of a single mercury cathode but two adjacent iron anodes, the arc alternating between these with the periodicity of the electricity supply. Specialised electrical control gear was necessary to run this lamp and provide means such that the  current waveform lagged the voltage waveform, to ensure that the arc would never completely extinguish during the zero-voltage phase of the AC electricity supply.",
						"A further drawback of all of these lamps was that they contained mercury in great excess and the vapour inside the tube was always saturated. In other words a change in lamp temperature would result in more or less mercury being vaporised into the discharge, with a consequent change in the electrical characteristics of the discharge and the light output. Such variations in ambient temperature or the supply voltage led to undesirable changes in lamp performance over a very wide range."

						"Ignition of the arc was performed crudely but effectively by a most intriguing action which was adopted from the methods used to start a carbon arc. When energised, the full voltage would be applied across the length of the lamp - this being insufficient to prevent electrical breakdown of the internal atmosphere (essentially a hard vacuum plus the vapour pressure of mercury at room temperature). Of course, the required striking voltage can be reduced by decreasing the gap between the electrodes, and when one is fortunate enough to have a liquid electrode this is easily attainable! The entire tube would be tilted by hand, and with moderate skill a continuous electrically-conductive bead of mercury could be made to flow from the reservoir down to the iron anode. It would be allowed to touch the anode thus directly short-circuiting the lamp.",
						"The lamp would then be tilted back to its original orientation, and a small arc struck between the anode and the bead of mercury as soon as contact was broken. It was then a simple matter to allow the mercury to run back down to its reservoir at the opposite end, thereby drawing the arc up to the full length of the discharge tube. It was a requirement to burn lamps at a slight angle with the mercury reservoir at the lowest point to ensure that the liquid electrode remained in its proper location thereafter. The complete manual ignition process is illustrated in Figure 13."

						"The troublesome effort of having to manually tilt every lamp in an installation to ignite the discharge is easy to appreciate, and it was not long before automatic methods were devised to electro-magnetically or pneumatically tilt the lamps and start them without human intervention. Of course, such methods were still rather cumbersome, and eventually a more scientifically orientated ignition method was devised.",
						"Self-striking lamps were provided with an electrically conductive coating on the outside upper surface of the glass bulb directly above the mercury reservoir, so that there was a vacuum space between this external 'electrode' and the mercury in the lower portion of the tube. The conductive coating was connected directly to the anode at the opposite end of the tube - the intention being to increase the electric field strength above the mercury pool. The external electrode usually took the form of a ring of conductive paint applied to the bulb, but sometimes a wire hoop in close proximity to the bulb was employed, the general arrangement being illustrated in Figure 14.",
						"In parallel with the lamp was wired a miniature mercury tilt switch, essentially a tiny scaled-down Cooper-Hewitt lamp itself, known as the 'shifter'. The  shifter would be physically located directly alongside the series-wired inductive ballast which controlled the discharge current of the main lamp, and orientated such that in its resting position its own mercury dose would directly short-circuit the main lamp. Then on energising the system, a high current would flow through the windings of the inductance coil, bypassing the lamp by means of the mercury shifter which was short-circuiting it, the flow of current generating a strong magnetic field around the windings of the coil. The shifter was mounted very lightly such that it would be influenced by this magnetic field, causing it to tilt and drain its mercury charge to  one end, thus breaking the circuit. The magnetic field built up around the windings would then collapse to zero at an extremely rapid rate, thereby inducing a high voltage kick which was sufficient to ionise the space between the mercury cathode and the external anode in the main lamp. (Incidentally, no ionisation takes place in the mercury shifter tube because it is itself wired in series with another small resistance, such that the route of lowest resistance is not through the shifter tube, but across the main lamp and its external electrode).",
						"The small arc occurring above the mercury pool in the main lamp was sufficient to generate a good deal of mercury vapour and ionise it, and almost instantaneously the arc would then jump from the small external anode to the main internal anode electrode at the opposite end of the tube (of course, this proved a route of lower resistance since the main anode is internal, whereas the small external anode ring is dielectrically separated by the glass bulb).",
						"If the lamp struck successfully then the magnetic field around the windings of the inductance coil would be quickly restored and it was still sufficiently great to hold the mercury shifter in its open-circuit position. However if the lamp did not strike up on its first attempt, the shifter would fall back to its resting position and short-circuit the lamp again, this entire process repeating itself as many times as was necessary until the lamp was successfully lit. A typical wiring diagram for the whole automatic starting arrangement is illustrated in Figure 15.",
						"The system of employing the external electrode plus auxiliary mercury shifter proved to be extremely reliable. Oil-filled or quick-acting circuit breakers were often tried as an alternative to the mercury shifter but proved temperamental and would not work all of the time. It is interesting to note that a higher induced voltage will be produced by the inductance coil for whichever device breaks the current flow through it the most rapidly - the magnitude of the high voltage kick of course depending on how rapidly the magnetic field around the windings collapses. Here the mercury shifter has an advantage, accounted for by the uniquely rapid deionisation of cold mercury vapour and the heat-dissipating properties of its volatile contact points. It was also observed that the colder the shifter, the more effective it would be. In hot weather the shifter would contain a greater pressure of mercury vapour itself, which resulted in a slower breaking of the circuit and less reliable lamp ignition (but still more reliable than any other form of rapid-acting circuit breaker)."

						"The fabrication of Cooper-Hewitt lamps was carried out completely by manual glassblowing operations, and while this alone is a fascinating topic, of greater interest is the unique method by which the lamps were exhausted and dosed with mercury.",
						"When ready for exhausting the lamps would be charged with about twice the required quantity of mercury, and hung vertically in an upright gas furnace or a hot air oven. The lamp was attached to an ordinary vacuum system via a small glass exhaust tube affixed to the upper end of the lamp just beside the iron anode. A plain rotary vacuum pump, which could evacuate the tube to a pressure of around 0.1 torr, was entirely suitable for the operation. A large mercury trap was placed in-line between the lamp and pump to prevent mercury transport back into the pump.",
						"The ovens would then be ignited, gradually raising the temperature of the glass to outgas it and also bringing the mercury slowly up to its boiling temperature. The relatively heavy mercury vapour would then begin to rise up from the reservoir at the bottom of the lamp, and like a piston, would push all air, water vapour and foreign gases up to the top of the tube and out of the lamp. As the temperature continued to rise and the glass was brought perilously close to its softening temperature, the mercury would begin to boil vigorously and the lamp itself was turned into a highly efficient mercury vapour diffusion pump, producing its own high vacuum devoid of all volatile substances except the mercury itself, which was present in great excess.",
						"Simultaneously an alternating current arc would be struck inside the lamp at a potential of some 4000 to 6000 Volts, further heating the boiling mercury cathode and rendering the iron anode incandescent at white-heat to ensure that it was thoroughly outgassed.The fabrication of Cooper-Hewitt lamps was carried out completely by manual glassblowing operations, and while this alone is a fascinating topic, of greater interest is the unique method by which the lamps were exhausted and dosed with mercury.",
						"When a measured quantity of mercury had been boiled out of the lamp and collected in the trap, the process would be stopped and the exhaust tube quickly melted over while all was still hot, thus sealing the remainder of the mercury inside the lamp under ultra-high vacuum. Thereafter the pressure inside the lamp is related only to the cold spot temperature of the mercury - some 357°C in operation, the boiling point of mercury under vacuum. Because of this limitation the pressure inside Cooper-Hewitt lamps rarely ever rose above 1 torr when in operation."

						"Until 1932 illumination with mercury lighting had been a complicated affair with unreliable lamps that required horrendously complex control systems. They were a true nightmare to manufacture, and they also gave a poor quality of light with only a moderately good system efficiency. As a result they were confined exclusively to areas which either needed a very large amount of light and the colour quality was of no concern (i.e. in photo-printing shops), or for use as ultra-violet sources in special laboratory and medical applications.",
						'That all changed in June 1932 when the Osram division of the General Electric Company of England unveiled its new "Osira" lamp which was to revolutionise the future of electric discharge lighting worldwide. It was the first time that a discharge lamp had been offered in a compact, clean and efficient package which customers could instantly appreciate how to use in new applications with the utmost simplicity. A 1933 advertisement for the new lamp is reproduced in Figure 18 to the right.',
						"So many of the features on which virtually all modern discharge lamps rely were introduced at this time, indeed it would not be inaccurate to describe this British development as the first practical discharge lamp on which nearly all modern descendents are based in one way or another. It introduced many 'firsts', for instance: An arc tube  sealed within in a transparent outer bulb for thermal insulation. A simple single-ended design with screw cap for ease of installation. An unsaturated vapour in which the entire mercury dose is vaporised. A compact arc to facilitate its use in ordinary optical systems. A hot cathode to enable high power loadings. A simple starting system which relies on no moving parts. Operation from a  simple choke-type ballast",
						"On the following pages in this section, full details pertaining to the first lamp and the first installation of mercury streetlighting can be found, and the complete development of the MA Medium Pressure Mercury lamp is followed right up to the time at which it was eventually superseded by higher pressure MB versions."

						"The first truly successful mercury lamp to operate at a high pressure was invented and developed by The General Electric Company of England during the years 1923-1932. It was marketed later that year, although remarkably the fact that it employed mercury vapour was kept secret until 1933 when lamps became available in  quantity and competitors began to introduce their own equivalents. Until that time it was known simply as the \"Osira\" Luminous Tube lamp. In later terminology it was classified as the MA lamp, 'M' standing for Mercury and 'A' signifying a medium-pressure discharge operating in a glass tube with a power loading of more than ten watts per centimetre of arc length. Incidentally the name Osira was introduced because until the second world war, the GEC was only licensed to use its Osram brand name on metal filament incandescent lamps. It had been granted that right by the German firm Osram many years earlier because the GEC was responsible for manufacturing and marketing metal filament incandescent lamps according to Osram's design throughout the British Empire - but it was only permitted to use the name on those products. This imposition fell at the time of the second world war                 and thereafter, all GEC lamps bore the Osram name.",
						"The GEC knew that mercury lighting could be efficient on account of the performance of the lamps made by Cooper-Hewitt and Küch &amp; Retschinsky, but neither of those products was of practical use for general lighting applications.",
						"In 1923 a research effort began at the Hirst Research Laboratories in Wembley to improve upon these crude early designs and develop a new lamp which would overcome most of their shortcomings, creating a market for itself as a real alternative to the incandescent lamp in everyday applications. It was quickly identified that the following key points would have to be satisfied in order to realise such a lamp: A mercury vapour pressure of at least one atmosphere. Complete vaporisation of the whole mercury dose for improved lamp stability. A glass tube capable of continuous operation at a minimum of 600°C. Highly emissive electrodes to carry a high lamp current for at least 1000 hours. A means of insulation to protect the discharge tube from draughts of cold air. Compact dimensions to facilitate its use in standard optical systems",
						'The GEC scientists theorised that such a lamp would attain a luminous efficacy 3 times greater than that of the tungsten filament lamps, and that its colour would be improved to the point that it was suitable, at least, for street and industrial lighting. They promptly set about designing a lamp along these principles which would be a satisfactory replacement for the thousand-watt tungsten lamp, the workhorse of industrial and area lighting at the time. Many other discharge lamps were conceived during this period of intense research, the basis of the fluorescent tube and the hot-cathode neon lamp to name a few, but the real fruits of their work came in 1932 in the form of the "Osira" mercury lamp pictured below.',
						"At the heart of the lamp is an arc tube fabricated from a new Aluminosilicate glass developed by the GEC specifically for this lamp. The electrode requirements were met through a modification of the old Wehnelt cathode, and consist of a pelleted mixture of barium, calcium and strontium silicates held in a heavy coil of tungsten wire. The spacing between the electrodes is 182mm, the inside diameter of the arc tube 34mm, and it contains 5 torr of argon plus a few milligrams of mercury. In operation the entire mercury dose is vaporised and the arc tube attains a temperature of around 550°C, the coldest spot still being in excess of 360°C and this delivers a mercury vapour pressure of precisely one atmosphere (nearly four times greater than had ever been achieved in a practical lamp). Because all of the mercury is vaporised in operation, changes in ambient temperature or supply voltage have very little effect on lamp performance because they cannot cause more or less mercury to be vaporised into the discharge. The arc tube is housed in a sealed, nitrogen-filled tube to protect it from cold draughts of air which could influence the mercury pressure (note the pip top), the resulting lamp being equipped with a GES (E40s) screw cap and measuring 50mm in diameter by 300mm long.",
						"The new lamp operated at 400 Watts  delivering 14,400 lumens, and had a life of 1,200 hours. Thus not only had it succeeded in matching the output of the 1000W tungsten lamp, it achieved this with less than half the power consumption - its luminous efficacy being 36 lm/W. The high mercury vapour pressure ensured that although the spectrum was still completely devoid of any red wavelengths, the blue intensity had decreased to levels which made its colour acceptable for street and industrial lighting. The precise spectral power distribution of the 400W MA lamp is shown in Figure 20 to the right."

						"On the 22nd June 1932, history was made when the worlds first mercury vapour street lighting installation was switched on. The light source was the Osira 400W MA lamp which had been developed by The General Electric Company of England that year, and the location was East Lane in London, just outside the Hirst Research Laboratories and Wembley lamp works of that company. The lanterns were simple protective globes of clear glass which afforded no optical control, but nevertheless the effect was particularly striking. The new lamps lit the street with an efficacy 2.5 times greater than the 1000-watt tungsten lamps they replaced, bathing the road in a daylight colour light with spectacular intensity.",
						"Not surprisingly the installation sparked considerable interest not just within the Corporation of London, but throughout the whole country and indeed internationally as well. City engineers travelled from all over the world to witness the striking brilliancy with which these innovative new lamps were lighting the road.",
						"This first installation was merely an experimental trial for the GEC, and within a few months it became clear that it should be conducted more scientifically, with new lanterns developed specifically to work with the tall  column of light created by the Osira lamps, which had to be burned vertically. On the 2nd March 1933 an improved installation was put into service on the adjacent Watford Road (Figure 21).",
						"Forty-six units were employed over a one-mile stretch of the road, and a new unit of highly original appearance, the Watford Road lantern, was designed for the Osira lamps. The lantern is shown both by day and by night in Figure 21. It was noted straight away that owing to the fact that the light was generated from a tall vertical column of luminous vapour, rather than the tiny compact source of filament lamps, that the arc itself was conducive to soft shadows and good diffusion. The overall level of visibility was said to be quite excellent."

						"The early days of MA lamp production was a time of intensive research and development, with work concentrating in two separate fields - firstly, methods had to be found to de-skill the production of the lamps and bring their price down. The principal developments on that topic are explained in the section on lamp manufacture. Secondly, there was a tremendous drive to further increase the performance of the lamps in just about every aspect - these being the subject of this page.",
						"In view of the tremendous luminous efficacy of the first 400W MA lamp, customers wasted no time in requesting lamps of different wattages to extend the range of applications. A 250W version soon followed and by 1939 a larger 650W model had also been brought into production. But customers were not satisfied with these ratings alone, what they really wanted was a much lower wattage so that the mercury lamp could be introduced to replace ordinary tungsten lamps.",
						"To meet this demand lampmakers created the 150W MA lamp in 1936, but the reason for the delay soon became obvious. Its efficacy was considerably reduced for two reasons. Firstly, when smaller lamps are made, the volt drop across the arc should really be allowed to decrease but this could not be tolerated because it made brought with it an increase in lamp current. This made the ballast very inefficient due to increased Joule heating of its windings when run at such a high current. The lamp volts had to be held inconveniently high and a reduced current was required to make the lower wattage possible, this decreasing the power loading in the arc. Figure 23 shows how lamp efficacy falls with reduced loading.",
						"Secondly, the electrical losses occurring just in front of the electrodes are of a similar magnitude whatever the lamp wattage, so although the wattage dissipated in the arc column was decreased, the electrode losses remained substantially the same, meaning that these losses become more significant for the smaller lamps. This phenomenon is explained more fully in the section on lamp electrodes. As a result luminous efficacy always becomes progressively worse for lower wattage lamps of any type, this rule being applicable to all discharge lamps. The 150W MA lamp was not a commercial success, and enjoyed only a few years in production. The introduction of lower wattage mercury products had to wait a few years until the development of the MB style lamp made it feasible with higher efficacy, as described in the next section.",
						"Meanwhile manufacturers concentrated on developing the high wattage market, where efficacy of course becomes higher for larger lamps. A 1000W lamp joined the range in 1939 (this was a bare arc tube type), and in the USA a very long high voltage 3000W lamp soon followed (type H-9). It operated at 535V with a lamp current of 6.25A, the arc length being 1220mm and the tube diameter 30mm. Essentially it can be thought of as eight 400W arc tubes connected together end-to-end, the wattage being slightly lower than 8 x 400W on account of the fact that there are only power losses from two electrodes, rather than from the sixteen electrodes that would be used in eight 400W lamps. The voltage also was lower to account for the fact that the volt drop of only one rather than eight pairs of electrodes was present. Its rather unwieldy dimensions confined it to industrial lighting areas with very high ceilings, but its length was found to be an advantage in photo-printing shops.",
						'In the UK attention was directed at high wattage lamps of more compact dimensions and 2500W types were employed in many trial installations, but were never marketed on a large scale. These had a high efficacy of 52lm/W derived from a much more compact arc 400mm in length with a tube diameter of 65mm. The lamp voltage was 145 Volts and the current 18.5 Amps. Although the arc bows upwards about 1/2" above the tube axis when used horizontally, it is prevented from touching the discharge tube wall by the field produced in the return lead which is affixed to the top of the arc tube. An experimental BTH 2500W lamp for industrial floodlighting is pictured in Figure 24.',
						"Some of the more common technical specifications for the range of British MA lamps is detailed in Table 1 below. All figures relate to 1950 lamps designed for a 230 / 240 V A.C. mains electricity supply. Source - Electric Lamp Manufacturers Association, Electric Discharge Lamp Sub-Committee, Internal Agreed Data for Group IX Lamps.",
						"The first MA lamps were strictly classified as the type MA/V, the V implying that they were suitable only for burning vertically in the cap-up position. A similar MA/D lamp was also made available, this type being suitable for vertical cap-down use. The difference was quite simply that the arc tube was inverted, such that the tip-off where its exhaust tube is sealed off from the vacuum system would always be on the upper end of the arc tube. The reason for this is because temperatures can be a little lower inside this tip-off area, and mercury can condense here with the effect that it is not all vaporised into the discharge so the the lamp might not run up to full power. Because heat rises, it is prudent to locate this tip-off at the uppermost end of the arc tube where it is less likely to present a cold spot and interfere with lamp performance.",
						"Vertical operation is rather inconvenient though on account of the complex luminaire designs that are required to redirect the light and send it down onto the horizontal plane, especially for streetlighting lanterns. Horizontal operation is much more desirable, but could not be tolerated. In the MA lamp the central cord of the arc is at a very high temperature while the outer periphery is much cooler, and this temperature differential sets up strong convection currents. In the horizontal position these are sufficiently strong to cause the arc to be swept upwards at its centre, bringing it into direct contact with the wall of the discharge tube. The elevated temperatures this would cause could not be tolerated, since the discharge tube glass would soften and blister outwards on account of the positive internal pressure. Lamp failure would quickly ensue. A photograph illustrating this upward bow is shown in Figure 25.",
						"Since the arc itself is in effect a flexible electric conductor, and all conductors are influenced by the presence of a magnetic field, a system was conceived by BTH whereby the arc could be forced back down near to the centre of the discharge tube by an external electromagnet. By wiring this electromagnet in series with the lamp the alternating field it produces is of course automatically brought into phase with the discharge current, and by correctly positioning the deflection coil it is most effective at preventing the arc from touching the discharge tube wall. This kind of magnetic deflection  proved very popular in Great Britain and thereafter, the vast majority of streetlighting lanterns switched over to horizontally burning lamps.",
						"Typical deflectors only consumed about 3 to 5 Watts but had to be precisely located to be effective and soon came to be seen as a cumbersome and heavy addition to many luminaires. Lampmakers therefore directed their attention to making a new lamp which could burn horizontally without the deflector, this resulting in the MA/H type. By reducing the quantity of mercury per unit of arc length, the speed of the convection currents in the arc tube are reduced and the effect of this is to minimise the upward bow of the arc. It was a combination of this and an arc tube 2mm larger in diameter that led to the introduction of the MA/H lamp. However the lower mercury vapour pressure in these designs and their lower volt drop meant that their luminous efficacy was about 10% less than for vertical burning types. This sacrifice was felt to be worthwhile in view of the fact that simple low-cost luminaires could then be created, which made up for the loss of lamp performance through the ability to employ more efficient optical systems.",
						"In the early 1950's a new kind of lamp was placed on the market, this being the MA/U designed for universal burning without any deflection coil. It was made possible through the development of a new glass type having a softening temperature approximately 50°C higher than the original kind. In addition the arc length was slightly shortened and this reduced the extent to which it would bow upwards. Consequently it could be burned horizontally without fear of overheating. The quantity of mercury per unit arc length was almost as much as in the first MA/V types so efficacy was high, and as a result it was capable of superseding both previous types of lamp. Horizontal efficacy was still 10% lower than vertical due to convection losses, but it matched the performance of each of the dedicated MA/H and MA/V lamps and was therefore able to supersede them both.",
						"Since the inception of the mercury lamp, attempts were made by numerous methods to improve its colour rendering properties. Right from the start the GEC had considered adding various other metals to the mercury arc which would provide some radiation at the red end of the spectrum, and a lamp containing cadmium and zinc in addition to mercury was trialled. This increased the red ratio of the lamp from 1% to about 2%, effectively doubling the small amount of red light present. Such lamps were never marketed though in the MA format - firstly, these additive metals radiated many lines in the UV and IR parts of the spectrum and the efficacy of the mercury discharge was reduced by some 15%. In addition early lamps made with these additions suffered rapid blackening of the arc tube and a useful service life could not be attained.",
						"Attention was therefore focussed on a fluorescent mercury lamp instead, in which the inside of the outer bulb was coated with a fluorescent substance. Ideally the material should absorb ultraviolet wavelengths and re-radiate them in the red part of the spectrum to improve the colour rendering. In 1937 a so-called MAF lamp was placed on the market, based on a fluorescent coating of zinc cadmium sulphide. This lamp is described fully under the section relating to sulphide phosphors.",
						"An alternative and highly innovative solution to the problem of colour correction was presented in 1935 by Dr. J.N. Aldington and Mr. W.H. Le Maréchal of the British Siemens Bros. company (of no connection to Siemens of Germany). Thirty years earlier Peter Cooper-Hewitt had proven than ordinary incandescent lamps of an appropriate rating could be successfully employed as a ballast for the mercury discharge, and that their excess of red light perfectly complemented the bluish light of the mercury discharge. But it was the aforementioned Siemens men who were first to combine arc tube and filament all within one outer bulb though, creating the first mercury lamp which did not require an external ballast and which also had excellent colour rendering properties."

						"The first MA lamp had only two electrodes, simply to sustain the main arc and nothing else.&nbsp; To cause the initial breakdown in the discharge tube and ionise the gas filling a high voltage gradient is always required, the precise voltage depending on fill pressure of the argon gas, and on the ratio between the length and diameter of the discharge tube.&nbsp; Naturally the argon pressure is chosen to give the lowest breakdown voltage, and although the length to diameter ratio is quite low for MA lamps, the effect of wall charges means that the ordinary mains voltage is not high enough to strike the discharge on its own.&nbsp; In practice, most 400W MA lamps would require a pulse of 300-500V to initiate the discharge if no auxiliary method was employed to lower this value.&nbsp; In the first experimental installations of MA lamps the voltage pulse was provided by a small Tesla coil included in the control circuitry.&nbsp; The method was crude though and the incorporation of a Tesla transformer into each lighting fitting would have added great expense and inconvenience, so it was superseded in readiness for the first commercial installation with MA Mercury lamps.",
						"By locating a third small electrode in very close proximity to one of the main electrodes, the striking voltage of the lamp can be considerably reduced by virtue of the fact that the gap between these two electrodes is small, so the voltage gradient between them is high and the gas filling is easier to break down.&nbsp; The standard method is to include a simple tungsten or molybdenum wire directly beside the main electrode at the cap end of the arc tube.&nbsp; This is connected via a high resistance (approximately 50 kW) to the main electrode at the opposite end of the tube.&nbsp; The principal of operation is exactly the same as for the self-starting Cooper-Hewitt lamps already described.&nbsp; In the MA case however, the starting electrode is inside the arc tube so no high voltage kick is required - ionisation between the main electrode and the adjacent auxiliary takes place at normal operating voltages, the lamp striking voltage being lowered to as little as 100V in some cases.&nbsp; There is more than enough safety margin between this and the usual 240V mains supply voltage to ensure that ignition will always take place even during dips in the mains voltage, in colder atmospheres or later in lamp life when the striking voltage always tends to rise by a small amount.",
						"A small glow discharge is easily initiated between the starting electrode and the main electrode beside it, the discharge current being limited to approximately one thousandth of the normal lamp current by the resistor.&nbsp; Once ionisation has taken place in the vicinity of the auxiliary electrode, the tube becomes conducting and the arc moves almost instantly across the two main electrodes, because there is no resistance in this path.&nbsp; The same principle continues to be employed in all modern mercury and many metal halide lamps as well.&nbsp; A diagram of the self-starting MA arc tube and the wiring arrangement to the auxiliary electrode is shown in Figure 26.",
						"In the early days, the inclusion of a third auxiliary electrode was seen as rather tedious, adding cost and technical complexity to the lamp with the added chance that owing to the presence of an extra glass-to-metal seal, cracking of the arc tube was more likely resulting in an unreliable lamp design.&nbsp; Many experiments were therefore conducted with external starting electrodes, British Siemens and GE of America being the principal investigators of this field.",
						"In the most simple designs, a few turns of thin wire were looped around one end of the arc tube and connected to the electrode at the opposite end.&nbsp; One of the first Siemens designs is illustrated in Figure 27.&nbsp; Later this was improved upon by passing a thin strip of wire mesh around the outside of the tube and welding it to the arc tube support frame, which was connected to the main electrode at the opposite end.",
						"The effect of this was to neutralise the so-called 'grid effect' caused by wall charges on the arc tube that normally kept the striking voltage higher than would be expected, and the external electrode was able to produce ionisation inside the discharge tube due to the capacitance between this and the internal main electrode.&nbsp; This very considerably reduces the required striking voltage to a level which is usually attainable from the mains electricity supply.&nbsp; However at ordinary mains frequencies of 50-60Hz it is not completely effective, the internal electrode remaining much more reliable.&nbsp; Consequently the external starting electrode was only widely used for lamps which were operated on a high frequency supply  such as the MBM Coal Mining lamp, or on lamps designed for operation on a high supply voltage as in the case of Philips' first MB lamp."

						"After switching on the lamp, the discharge strikes initially in an atmosphere of argon and low pressure mercury.&nbsp; For the first minute or so the light output is pitifully small and the colour noticeably blue.&nbsp; The efficiency of visible light generation is very small when the mercury vapour pressure is low, because ultraviolet lines dominate the spectrum.&nbsp; Another characteristic of the low pressure state is that the discharge fills the entire arc tube diameter with a diffuse glow, the efficacy being around 3 lm/W (Fig. 28.)",
						"Since the mercury vapour pressure is very low at this time (about 0.002 torr), the electrical characteristics of the discharge are determined mainly by the argon gas filling.&nbsp; The resistance is practically zero so the voltage drop across the arc is  low, typically 20V or so, and the current is as high as the ballast can provide under what are effectively short-circuit conditions.&nbsp; Typically the starting current is around 1.7 times the normal lamp current.&nbsp; For a 400W lamp this starting current is 5.5 to 6A, and the power in the arc tube is about 100W.",
						"This high current must of course be carried by the electrodes and the period just after ignition is particularly damaging.&nbsp; This is why frequent switching reduces lamp life.",
						"As time progresses, the heat produced by this discharge begins to vaporise some of the mercury dose.&nbsp; The effect of this is to increase the voltage drop across the arc tube and more power is dissipated in the lamp so that its wattage increases.&nbsp; The increase in voltage is slow at first owing to the low power dissipation in the tube, but as more mercury is vaporised the power increases and the remainder of the mercury is evaporated more quickly, raising the lamp voltage simultaneously.&nbsp; As lamp wattage rises, so does the luminous flux.&nbsp; Similarly as lamp voltage rises, the current gradually falls to the normal operating value, relieving the load on the electrodes.&nbsp;",
						"Once all of the mercury has been evaporated the voltage drop thereafter becomes practically constant.&nbsp; The discharge tube still continues to heat up, and as no more mercury is available to be evaporated, the quantity which has already been vaporised is then said to enter superheat conditions.&nbsp; The wattage continues to rise a little higher, further increasing the mercury pressure and improving the efficacy and colour properties.&nbsp; Final operating pressure is determined by the temperature of the coldest spot of the arc tube, usually just behind the electrodes.&nbsp; Because of this it is desirable to make the gap between the back of the electrodes and the end of the arc tube as short as possible.&nbsp; The precise gap here is limited by the strength of the glass, which will crack if it becomes too hot in the area of the glass-to-metal seal.&nbsp; A temperature of 360°C is the maximum value attainable in practice, and this corresponds to a mercury vapour pressure of precisely one atmosphere. At such high pressure the arc becomes constricted into a narrow cord of high brightness, as is clearly visible in Figure 28.",
						"The whole running-up process takes about 9 minutes in the original designs of MA lamp, but is reduced for later models.&nbsp; If the mercury vapour pressure can be made to increase more rapidly then the lamp will run up faster, and in later lamps this was accomplished by applying a specular mirror of heat-reflecting platinum onto the ends of the arc tube just behind the electrodes to prevent heat losses here.&nbsp; The coating is always painted on in the form of platinum chloride which happens to be soluble in lavender oil, the resulting mixture being decomposed to a bright metal film by heating in air at around 500°C for 30 minutes.&nbsp; The effect is to reduce the run-up time to approximately 6 minutes in the case of 400W lamps, and 7 minutes for the 250W size.&nbsp; Faster run-up is advantageous not only for practical reasons, but because it takes the electrodes out of the high-load condition more rapidly and maximises their lifetime while reducing the rate of arc tube blackening.&nbsp; The location of the platinum coating is shown in Figure 29.",
						"Illustrated in Figure 30 below is a graph showing how the voltage, current, wattage and luminous flux change while the MA type lamp is warming up to full power.&nbsp; If there is an interruption to the mains electricity supply and the arc extinguishes, it cannot be re-ignited straight away as the striking voltage of of mercury vapour rises very rapidly with increasing pressure.&nbsp; 5,000 to 10,000V is required to instantly re-strike a hot 400W MA lamp.&nbsp; Typically 10 minutes is required for the lamp to cool back down to a level at which the mains voltage will be sufficiently high to re-ignite it.&nbsp; There is then a further delay while the lamp runs back up to its full intensity again."

						"Developments in glass technology, a field in which the GEC had tremendous expertise, are what ultimately led to the feasibility of the MA lamp.&nbsp; In the Cooper-Hewitt lamps borosilicate had been employed, but it was not possible to run this at a particularly high temperature and consequently a high mercury pressure could not be built up.&nbsp; Quartz was known from the Spanner and Bastian lamps which evolved from the Küch &amp; Retschinsky developments, and although this was more than suitable in terms of its refractory properties, its  thermal expansion coefficient was so low that no satisfactory method of sealing metal conductors through it was known.&nbsp; The techniques which were employed were all extremely tedious and frequently cracked or leaked, thus the quartz lamps could only be used in applications where they did not have to be relied on as a source of light, confining them mainly to medical and scientific applications.",
						"The GEC Glassworks at Lemington and the glass technologists at Wembley were therefore charged with developing a glass which was more refractory than borosilicate, but which still had a high coefficient of thermal expansion so that metal wires could be sealed through it.&nbsp; It was also required to have a high electrical resistivity at the elevated temperatures it was to operate at, and it had to resist any chemical attack from superheated mercury vapour and oxide coatings originating from the electrodes.&nbsp; This occupied the bulk of the period spent in developing the MA lamp, but was outstandingly successful.&nbsp; A new family of glasses called the aluminosilicates were developed expressly for this application, resulting in the GEC's popular H26X glass type.",
						"Essentially the principal component of borosilicate glasses, boric oxide, had been substituted with aluminium oxide.&nbsp; This had the effect of increasing the softening temperature by a crucial 200°C, and the coefficient of thermal expansion actually rose slightly above that of the borosilicates.&nbsp; It was found to be perfectly suitable for sealing directly to lightly oxidised molybdenum wire.&nbsp; The higher expansion awkwardly made the glass more sensitive to thermal shock, and in consideration of this protracted annealing schedules had to be introduced every time the glass was heated up to softening temperatures.&nbsp; In this respect aluminosilicate is perhaps the most hated material of glass technologists, it seemed you only had to frown at a batch of finished lamps and they'd promptly crack!&nbsp; Nevertheless with care, it could be worked and techniques were found to reliably seal molybdenum conductors through it.",
						"Shortly after Osram showed the Osira lamp, British Thomson-Houston became active in making aluminosilicate glasses and was soon manufacturing its own C14 grade at the Chesterfield glassworks.&nbsp; The expansion coefficient was 37x10-7 m/°C and the softening temperature was 730°C, derived from a glass comprising 58.5% Silica, 22.5% Alumina, 3.0% Boric Oxide, 15.2% Oxides of Mg, Ba and Ca, and 0.8% Oxides of Na and K.",
						"In the following years BTH devoted great efforts to further increase the softening temperature of its aluminosilicate glasses, the efforts of J.E. Stanworth and A.E. Dale at the BTH Research Laboratory in Rugby being especially significant.&nbsp; Many of the principal technical papers covering this important period of development were authored by these scientists.&nbsp; In the late 1940's the new Chesterfield C37 glass was introduced, in which the softening temperature was raised to 760°C and this permitted a further increase in lamp efficacy.&nbsp; In 1950 the C46 glass made its debut, again offering higher performance with a softening temperature of 775°C.&nbsp; This last development was important because it meant that for the first time, an efficient lamp which was suitable for universal burning in any orientation could be made.&nbsp; Previously when lamps were burned horizontally, the upward bow of the arc due to convection currents required that an external magnetic deflector be used to prevent the arc from overheating and destroying the arc tube.&nbsp; Until the advent of C46 glass, special lamps were designed for horizontal operation with a larger diameter arc tube and lower mercury dose which meant that their luminous efficacy fell slightly.&nbsp; The new harder C46 glass was just able to tolerate the higher wall temperatures present in horizontally-burned lamps of the standard pattern though, and one universal burning lamp could be marketed which offered full efficiency in either horizontal or vertical orientations.",
						"In the USA the production of aluminosilicates was adopted first by General Electric in 1934, this company having a full patent licensing agreement with BTH so that both companies could immediately make use of each others developments.&nbsp; Corning Glassworks of New York soon took up the manufacture of similar aluminosilicate glasses as well, these being supplied to Westinghouse and Sylvania to enable those firms to also enter the mercury lamp business."

						"There was little point in having a new glass which could endure such a high loading if there did not exist a method of carrying suitably large currents into the lamp to develop this high loading.&nbsp; All previous lamps had relied on a liquid mercury electrode, but this was no longer possible since the increased pressure in MA lamps required them to&nbsp; operate at temperatures so high that any mercury would be completely vaporised.",
						"The only practical way to inject high currents into such a lamp is by means of a hot cathode, which emits copious quantities of electrons at its elevated operating temperature due to the principle of thermionic emission.&nbsp; Osram-GEC had been working on hot cathodes in an attempt to increase the power density of linear neon and fluorescent lamps, and the company was also well experienced in the use of similar electrodes at its Marconi-Osram Valve works, which shared the same premises as the lamp works in Hammersmith, London, for the manufacture of radio valves and other electronic tubes.&nbsp; There was no shortage of knowledge in this field and a new cathode was soon developed that met the particularly severe requirements of the mercury lamp.&nbsp;",
						"Had pure heated tungsten been used it would have run ridiculously hot and been evaporated and sputtered away rapidly, staining the arc tube black and absorbing much of the light the lamp generated.&nbsp; This is because  tungsten has a high 'work function', in other words large amounts of energy are necessary to eject electrons from its surface, the energy being wasted as heat and without contributing to the light output of the lamp.&nbsp; This&nbsp; leads to a large voltage gradient immediately in front of the cathode which is emitting negatively charged electrons and receiving positively charged ions.&nbsp; The high electric field strength, called the cathode fall, accelerates these ions into the electrode at high velocity and because of their great mass they bombard it with significant force, physically destroying the electrode by sputtering it and further exacerbating the arc tube blackening problem mentioned above.&nbsp; Lamp life is dependent upon the rate at which the electrodes are gradually obliterated by this continual process.&nbsp; The electrode must therefore be designed in such a way that it can receive these ions while suffering the least possible damage.&nbsp; The way to accomplish this is to reduce the work function of the electrode so that it emits electrons freely, the volt drop ahead of it then being minimised, and the ions can be received with minimal impact.&nbsp; The principle is illustrated diagramatically in Figure 31.",
						"Other metals have lower work functions than tungsten, but are not so refractory and cannot endure the high temperatures present in the lamp without melting or physically evaporating, which leads to the same blackening problem.&nbsp; The electrode requirements were eventually met through a modification of the old Wehnelt cathode, developed in Germany in 1904.&nbsp; Wehnelt had identified that the thermionic emission from a heated wire is very considerably increased if it is coated with a layer of barium oxide.&nbsp; It now known that is due to the formation of a monolayer of barium metal over the surface of the wire, just one atom thick, these coatings having an extremely low work function value.&nbsp; In modern electrodes, barium oxide is often employed with the oxides of strontium and calcium, which have the effect of reducing the rate of evaporation of barium.&nbsp; Thorium oxide is often employed as well to further reduce the work function.",
						"An electron-emissive pellet of barium-calcium-strontium oxide was located at the heart of the electrode in the first Osira lamp, this imparting a very low work function to the electrode and enabling it to run at a relatively low temperature at which the effects of evaporation and sputtering are minimised. The pellet was located loosely inside a coil of tungsten wire and the electrode assemblies of this first lamp are pictured in Figure 32.&nbsp; Owing to the small diameter of the tungsten wire that was used the electrode still ran at a rather high temperature, and an improved design was soon introduced.&nbsp; Much heavier tungsten wire was used, and the pellet, protected inside this first coil, was then inserted into a second coil forming the main electrode.&nbsp; Heat was dissipated much better in this design, but still remaining just as effective as an electrode because of the existence of the monolayer over the coils.",
						"For convenience of manufacturing such electrodes, the electron-emissive pellet is never inserted in the form of the raw metal oxides.&nbsp; In the first Osira lamp the pellet was made from a mixture of barium-strontium-calcium silicates, and in nearly all lamps made thereafter the metal carbonates were employed instead.&nbsp; Before these compounds impart any benefit to the cathode they must first be converted to the oxide, and the monolayer of raw metal must be formed over the surface of the tungsten coil by a process known as electrode activation.&nbsp;",
						"The usual practice is to raise the electrodes to a very high temperature while the lamp is on the exhausting machine - either induced heating with a radio frequency oscillator or by passing a heavy electric current through the electrode if its shape permits this.&nbsp; Alternatively the electrodes may be activated by electron bombardment attained by striking a high current AC discharge in the arc tube, or by a combination of both methods.&nbsp; The high temperature treatment decomposes the metal carbonate or silicate to the oxide, the process being continued until all gases evolved during the process have been completely released and pumped away by a vacuum pump to which the arc tube is attached.&nbsp; At this high temperature in vacuum some reduction of the oxide then takes place leading to the formation of free barium metal which diffuses over the surface of the tungsten electrode thus forming the all-important monolayer for good electron emission.&nbsp; Thereafter the activated electrodes must not be allowed to come into contact with any air or oxygen since this would instantly destroy the monolayer and poison the electrodes, rendering them permanently useless.\n                                                                            &nbsp;",
						"During normal lamp operation, evaporation of the monolayer is continuously occurring as is the diffusion of fresh metal out of the pellet held within the coils.&nbsp; The rates of each of these processes is depending on the operating temperature of the electrode and it is important that the electrode for each lamp be designed in such a way that its operating temperature will cause the rate of each process to balance perfectly.&nbsp; If the monolayer is evaporated too quickly, the electrode will become deactivated and it will lose its emission and the lamp will fail.&nbsp; If fresh material is diffused out of the pellet too rapidly then similarly it will be evaporated away as quickly as it is produced, leading to arc tube blackening and premature exhaustion of the pellet again with the consequence that the lamp will fail early.&nbsp;",
						"Much of the scientific work in this field was conducted under Dr. J.N. Aldington of Siemens Electric Lamps &amp; Supplies in Preston, UK (no connection with Siemens of Germany).&nbsp; His research laboratories methodically tested literally hundreds of different electrode arrangements and lamp chemistries to obtain longer, more efficient lamp lives.&nbsp; The extent of the work carried out by Siemens is easy to recognise simply by virtue of the fact that today it is unusual to come across any two Siemens MA lamps of the same construction, practically all have different electrodes, starting aids or methods of assembly.&nbsp; In particular, many hollow cathode designs were investigated as well as different electron-emissive materials, all with the aim of lowering the lamp striking voltage, reducing the rate of arc tube blackening, and increasing electrode life.",
						"One other electrode worthy of mention is the type employed by BTH, in which thorium oxide was also incorporated into the emissive pellet.&nbsp; This, being a mildly radioactive substance, helps to cause ionisation in the discharge tube and lowers the striking voltage that is required."

						"The first Osira lamps were made entirely by hand, starting out essentially with just a plain glass tube.&nbsp; This would be domed over at one end to form a test-tube shaped object, the dome then being pierced with a small hole through which one of the electrodes was inserted, and sealed in by a glassblower with the aid of a gas torch and blowing pipe.&nbsp; Blowing was accomplished through the opposite end of the arc tube which was of course open.&nbsp; Another small hole was then blown beside the first seal, and the auxiliary starting electrode sealed in.&nbsp; Following this yet another hole was made and a short length of exhaust tubing was attached.&nbsp;",
						"Attention was then directed at the opposite open end of the arc tube which had next to be domed over just as was done to the first end.&nbsp; By transferring the blowing pipe to the exhaust tube, a hole could be blown in the heated dome at the second end of the arc tube.&nbsp; The second main electrode was then sealed in, this completing the physical construction of the arc tube. With all processes being carried out by hand a considerable amount of effort went into making the early lamps, reflected in their high sale price.",
						"BTH pioneered a method which considerably increased the speed with which MA arc tubes could be manufactured through a most ingenious innovation.&nbsp; Instead of building the arc tubes from straight glass tubing, the company pre-formed arc tubes to a near-final shape by blowing the glass into a specially shaped mould on automatic Westlake machines.&nbsp; It is easy to tell an arc tube which was made by the improved BTH process, because feint circular lines appear around the circumference of the arc tube, these impressions being left in the glass as a result of it being rotated inside its mould on the bulb-blowing machine.&nbsp; With early arc tubes made from drawn tubing, if there are any lines present in the glass surface they will be running parallel to the axis of the tube, these having been formed as a result of the tube drawing process.",
						"The only tasks requiring manual labour involved the piercing of three small holes in the dome end of the arc tube bulb, the main electrode, auxiliary electrode, and exhaust tube being attached one at a time after each hole was blown.&nbsp; Next, the final electrode was sealed into the constriction at the opposite end of the arc tube, this being a swift and easy process since the dome-ended shape here was almost completely formed.&nbsp; Final arc tube processing was then carried out on an automatic rotary exhausting machine which pumped, baked, illuminated and gas-filled the arc tube.&nbsp; The human touch was retained, however, for the tipping-off process in which the exhaust tube was melted over by hand-torch to remove the arc tube from the pumping machine - the precise shape of the tip being quite important for good lamp performance.&nbsp; The principal production stages for the blown-bulb arc tubes are illustrated below.",
						"Lamps made with these machine-blown bulbs proved to be quite superior to the earlier models.&nbsp; Aluminosilicate tubing was always hand-drawn prior to this development and despite the fact that a pair of skilled glassblowers could control the diameter of their&nbsp; tubing to within a millimetre of the required size, the tube was often not completely round or might have a slight taper in the wall thickness along its length.&nbsp; This affected the temperature distribution in finished lamps which affected the mercury vapour pressure, and the spread in luminous flux from one lamp to the next was often rather large as a result.&nbsp; The consistency of machine-blown bulbs greatly reduced this variation in lamp performance.&nbsp; As a result BTH was able to increase the average efficacy slightly, knowing that very few if any of the new lamps would be likely to be overloaded, as might have been the case with the uncertainty of hand drawn tubing.",
						"It was Siemens Bros. of Preston who completed the task of mechanising the production of MA arc tubes, through a variation of the aforementioned BTH process.&nbsp; Their method was later copied by Osram-GEC and Crompton, and by Westinghouse in the USA.&nbsp; The shape of the blown-bulb arc tube was modified to include a dimple at its crown.&nbsp; At the lamp works the tip of the dimple was removed, and the lower cullet portion similarly cut away, leaving an arc tube with two open ends having reduced diameters.",
						"One end of the arc tube was next lowered over the electrode assembly in a special pinch-sealing machine.&nbsp; Heat was applied to the constricted end of the arc tube and when the glass had reached its softening temperature, a pair of hammers softly pinched it flat around the lead wires thus forming a neat, good quality seal.&nbsp; The same was repeated at the opposite end of the arc tube and by this method, the production of MA lamps was greatly de-skilled.&nbsp; The consistency of electrode positioning improved and so did lamp performance.&nbsp; Because it was found too difficult to include an exhaust tube in the pinch-seal, this was attached to the arc tube side, again with the aid of a mechanical jig to pierce the hole and then fuse an exhaust tube over it.",
						"For lamps of unusual length or special diameters, a different manufacturing technique was employed since it was not economical to fabricate moulds into which semi-formed bulbs could be blown automatically.&nbsp; This production method was standard practice on the 1000W and 2500W lamps as well, which were not required in such large quantities.&nbsp; The arc tubes were made from drawn tubing, which was first heated at its centre while revolving in a glassblowing lathe.&nbsp; The heated central portion would be constricted inwards and the tube parted into two halves at this point, each half being left with a neatly domed end.",
						"A main electrode was then sealed into one half of the tube, and the other electrode, auxiliary, and exhaust tube attached to the other half of the tube.&nbsp; The two halves were then brought back together again and sealed together at their opposite ends to form the completed arc tube, as in Figure 35 below.",
						"To form a good seal between glass and metal, there are two conditions that must be satisfied.&nbsp; Firstly the softened glass must 'wet' the metal and adhere to it, and secondly the stresses developed by the different rates of expansion and contraction of the components must not exceed the strength of the glass such that the seals crack or leak.&nbsp; Molybdenum and tungsten have similar coefficients of thermal expansion to aluminosilicates, molybdenum being the higher of the two metals.&nbsp; Although tungsten is a better match in terms of the stated expansion coefficients, molybdenum has always been the preference in practical lamps.&nbsp; This is because the glass and metal do not heat up at the same rate when the lamp is switched on - heat is generated at the electrode which is welded to the leading-in wire and consequently this warms up more rapidly than the glass surrounding it.&nbsp; It is found that molybdenum seals are less likely to crack during warming up because of this situation.&nbsp; Glasses used in all but the first MA lamps typically had an expansion coefficient of around 43x10-7 m/°C.",
						'In most MA lamps the seals consist of ground moly wires 1.0mm (0.040") in diameter.&nbsp; The wire is of a specially prepared type to ensure that it is free of splits which might allow air to leak into a finished lamp, and thoroughly cleaned usually by an electropolishing method and by furnacing in hydrogen or under vacuum to remove included gases which might otherwise evolve bubbles in the glass seal during formation, possibly leading to cracking.&nbsp; However glasses do not wet pure molybdenum and stick to it, the seal is actually made to a thin layer of oxide of a precisely controlled thickness, formed by first bringing the metal to a cherry-red heat in a small gas flame.&nbsp; The wire is then beaded with a small glass sleeve of the same composition as the arc tube glass, the oxide layer dissolving into the bead and forming an excellent bond.&nbsp; The wire displays a metallic brown or sometimes deep gold colouration if the seal has been formed correctly.&nbsp; It is necessary to pre-sleeve the wires in this fashion, they cannot simply be sealed directly into the arc tube.&nbsp; The level of heat involved in sealing them in is so high that further oxidation would take place and an over-oxidised seal would be formed which would be quite likely to leak in service.',
						'The shape of the glass bead so formed is all-important as this determines the likelihood of a crack forming during lamp life.&nbsp; Some minor cracking is often inevitable and the shape of the bead and the distribution of internal stress must be controlled so that if a crack does form, it will not penetrate right through the wall of the lamp and cause an air leak (Scott, 1945).&nbsp; In final lamp assembly, the sleeved lead wire would then be sealed directly into a small hole which had been formed in the end of the arc tube.&nbsp; Seals of this type were successfully fabricated with wires up to 2.0mm diameter (0.080") for the manufacture of experimental 2,500 Watt MA lamps.',
						"The exhausting process of MA arc tubes was essentially the same for all of the different arc tube construction methods illustrated above.&nbsp; To remove all foreign impurities it was necessary to heat the arc tube to a temperature much higher than its operating temperature while under high vacuum, typical outgassing temperatures being of the order of 700°C or so.&nbsp; In the early days arc tubes were heated with a simple gas flame from a hand torch whose flame was cautiously played over the whole arc tube.&nbsp; As production volumes increased rotary automatic pumping machines were devised, very much along the lines of the equipment that had been developed for processing fluorescent tubes.&nbsp; Arc tubes went through several stages on this equipment.&nbsp; First they were pumped to rough vacuum, the vacuum quality gradually increasing as the bulb was heated to as high a temperature as possible without it sucking-in under the vacuum.&nbsp; They were then filled with argon and a high voltage high current AC discharge established in the lamps to render the electrodes brightly incandescent, thus activating the  emissive pellet and driving out impurities.&nbsp; After the baking, pumping and bombarding process the arc tube was given its final dose of spectroscopically pure argon.",
						"Throughout the entire process the tiny dose of mercury had to be kept out of the ovens and in a T-shaped appendage on the side of the exhaust tube - had it been heated it would have vaporised and been pumped away.&nbsp; When the arc tubes were hand-tipped off the exhausting machine, they were long-tipped above the point of the side T-piece.&nbsp; Once off the pump the lamp could be tilted and the mercury dose allowed to run into the arc tube.&nbsp; The long tip and side T-piece were then removed with the mercury inside the arc tube, the shape of the final tip-off being formed by skilled operators with the aid of gas torches."

						"In 1936 Philips announced the successful development of the first kind of MB Mercury lamp. It was called the Philora HP300, illustrated to the right, and it was made possible through a development of the quartz-to-metal seals that were described on the previous page. Instead of employing just one intermediate glass between the tungsten and quartz, several were used in a stack from high to low expansion, and this allowed the seal to operate at higher temperatures and without the slug of mercury in place to protect it. Removing the excess mercury also allowed the lamp to revert to the unsaturated vapour design invented by GEC with the MA lamp, in which the entire mercury dose is vaporised, and a stable discharge could again be developed. Owing to the use of a quartz bulb which could withstand higher operating temperatures, a relatively short arc could be adopted and the high power density which accompanied this led to a lamp of high luminous efficacy.\n\tThe first lamp consumed 75W and the efficacy was a remarkable 40 lm/W, the same as a 400W MA lamp. Its luminous flux was 300 dekalumens, the mercury pressure 20 atmospheres, the arc length 18mm and tube diameter 4mm. Its had a relatively high arc voltage of 230V (lamp current 0.4A) so the lamps had to be operated from transformers with an open circuit voltage of 410V. Total system efficacy was 33 lm/W.",
						"Although the internal auxiliary striking electrode had been introduced by GEC for its MA lamps three years earlier, it was not included in the first MB lamp shown above.&nbsp; It was already pushing the quartz to its very limits to get it to accept a single tungsten wire for the main electrode, and to seal two wires through side by side was absolutely out of the question.&nbsp; A few turns of nickel wire were therefore looped around one end of the arc tube, and connected to the electrode at the opposite end.&nbsp; Part of the reason for designing a lamp with such a high voltage was that the 410V open circuit voltage of the transformer was required to make this external electrode work to reliably strike the discharge.&nbsp; For a lamp designed to work at ordinary mains voltages and frequencies, the external auxiliary electrode technique is not always reliable. (An interesting exception exists in the case of the small 40W MBM mercury lamp found in British coal mines, the first ever discharge lamp to be driven on a high frequency power supply, featured here).",
						"Not only had Philips been successful in giving the world a low wattage and efficient mercury vapour lamp, the lamp was found to offer considerably better colour rendering properties than could be attained with MA lamps.  This is because the MB types operate at much higher pressure, and colour rendering always improves with increasing mercury pressure.  A very small amount of continuum radiation was found in the spectrum of this 20 atmosphere lamp, and its red ratio increased from the 1% level of the MA lamp to about 2.5%, with no loss in efficacy.  The spectral power distribution of the MB lamp is shown in Figure 38."

						"Once the first Philora HP300 lamp was beginning to sell in quantity, two principal features of its design were found to be unfavourable and required modifying.  First, the high arc voltage necessitated a special transformer ballast which was heavy, expensive and inefficient, and it was a severe obstacle to the marketing of the lamp.  Secondly, the arc tube was so small that it blackened rather quickly and the useful lamp life was short.  The pressure was on to create a new lamp which solved these two issues.\n\t\tIn the same way that all lampmakers of any significance had started making MA lamps within a few years of its invention by GEC, the same applied after Philips created the quartz MB lamp.  Philips, British Siemens and British Thomson-Houston in particular were three companies that devoted particular attention to solving the problems.\n\t\tTo get around the blackening issue it was decided to increase the arc tube diameter and make it longer, thus increasing its internal surface area.  To meet the requirements of a lamp which would work on an open circuit voltage of 220-240V, the arc voltage necessarily had to drop to around 120V.  This happened naturally as a result of the increased arc tube dimensions.",
						"There then arose the problem of how to strike the discharge on such a low open circuit voltage.  The practical solution was to return to a third auxiliary electrode located within the arc tube.  With skill it was found that another graded seal to a third tungsten wire could be added to the side of the arc tube, rather than running all of the sealing wires through the ends of the arc tube as had been  standard practice until this time.  Such a seal is displayed in Figure 39 to the right, and an example of a lamp made with this kind of seal can be seen by clicking here.",
						"A tremendous contribution to the future of the lamp industry was made in the early 1930's by Dr. Dennis Gabor OBE, the famed Hungarian inventor who is perhaps most famous as the father of holography, for which he won the Nobel Prize in 1971.",
						"In 1931 he took up employment in the Berlin labs of Siemens &amp; Halske (the predecessor of the present-day German Osram company, no connection with Osram-GEC of England).  While there he was charged with developing a high pressure cadmium lamp, which it was felt could be a viable alternative to mercury.  He realised that quartz had to be used as the arc tube material because cadmium tends to be quite corrosive towards other glasses, and devoted much of his attention to sealing metallic conductors through quartz.  In 1931 he was awarded a German patent for a method based on very thin, flat conductors of molybdenum.  These molybdenum strips were so thin that despite having a coefficient of expansion some 8 times greater than quartz, the foil was thin enough that the small amount it expanded by was not sufficient to rupture the seal.  Osram employed these seals in the manufacture of UV lamps for laboratory and medical applications and for many years they were unknown to other lighting firms who were struggling on a similar topic.  German Osram had little activity in mercury discharges for lighting applications at that time and surprisingly failed to realise the significance of Gabor's seal.",
						"With the rise of Hitler in 1933, Gabor left Germany and obtained employment as an inventor in the research laboratories of the British Thomson-Houston company in Rugby, England.  He was a great asset to the discharge lamp development team, where he introduced the company to his molybdenum foil seals and went on to develop many other ideas for BTH - one of the most famous being a ballastless discharge lamp.  Shortly after Philips put its first HP300 lamp on the market, BTH showed a very similar product but which was made with Gabor's molybdenum foil seals.  The reliability of the seal was improved by sharpening the sides of the foil to knife-edges by an electropolishing method, giving it an almost ragged appearance along the edges.  This eliminated the seal leaks that otherwise  occur if the edge of the foil is perfectly straight or not feathered, as a tiny airline would often be formed along these edges. With the moly foil seal it became easy to accommodate a third wire for the auxiliary striking electrode, and Gabor's arc tube, first marketed through BTH Mazda, set the standard for all quartz arc tubes right up to the early 1950's.  An arc tube made with molybdenum foil seals is shown below in Figure 41.",
						"A slight improvement on this seal was perfected by British Siemens, who recognised that a serious bottleneck in the lampmaking process was the handling of these thin foils and the welding of an electrode to one side, and a molybdenum lead wire to the other side.  The welding process may justifiably be described as completely out of control in the early days; getting tungsten to stick to molybdenum when spot-welded is quite an art!  The technique employed by Siemens was to take a molybdenum wire and press it flat in the centre.  That flattened region was then rolled to a very fine strip, and its edges sharpened as usual.  The component thus formed was a single piece consisting of the foil with a wire on either side, to which an electrode could be attached and external connections made.  The Siemens seal is shown in Figure 42. It was only short-lived though, because before long the welding problems were overcome by using intermediate so-called 'referee' metals which helped the parts stick together more strongly, as well as through improved control of the welding current.  Various methods were used and indeed still are used today.  The foil is often platinised on the side to be welded, or a small amount of platinum enamel may be applied before welding, or as an alternative a thin wire or strip of tantalum may be sandwiched between the parts to be welded.  The waveform of the current supplied to the welding electrodes is also of great importance in making a good quality joint.",
						"The most recent update to the method of forming a mercury arc tube was to mechanise the process of sealing the electrodes into the arc tube through a remarkably simple process innovation.  Instead of using atmospheric pressure to collapse the quartz down over the foil, a technique was developed which allowed the lampmaker to pinch the quartz flat around the foils on a fully automatic machine.  Oxidation of the molybdenum and electrodes was prevented by flushing argon through the tube to be sealed continuously during the heating process.\n\t\tTo ensure that the correct shape was formed around the electrodes at the ends of the arc tube, the tube diameter was first reduced at each end.  This was usually carried out by one of three methods.  The first was to manually stretch the end regions down to a smaller diameter while heating the tube, this method requiring skilled glassblowers and being rather time-consuming (Figure 43a).  Another method was to attach short lengths of narrow bore tubing to each end of the arc tube (Figure 43b).  Alternatively the tube was simply rilled-in at the region around the electrodes to form the correct shape here, and below this point the tube remained at its full diameter (Figure 43c).\n\t\tThe electrode mount assemblies were then located inside the vertically mounted arc tube on a special machine, a flow of argon was flushed into the assembly through the exhaust tube, and oxy-hydrogen fires rapidly brought the end of the tube up to its softening temperature over a period of about ten seconds.  Oscillating fires were normally employed to spread the heat out well over the entire surface of the area to be pinched.  Then in a split second heating would cease and a pair of brass hammers would fly in from either side and pinch the quartz flat around the foils.  The process was then repeated at the opposite end of the arc tube.",
						"The process of pre-shaping the arc tube ends prior to pinch sealing was rather tedious and something that lampmakers were keen to abandon in efforts to further speed the production.  In 1960 it was successfully abolished by incorporating a V-shape region into the top of the hammers used to make the quartz pinch-seal.  By heating a greater length of quartz at the end of the tube it could be partially pushed inwards as part of the pinching action, thereby forming a very neat conical end chamber around the electrodes.  This was the last process improvement made in the fabrication of MB style arc tubes, and since then the production method has remained largely unchanged.  To speed up the process alternative methods of heating have been introduced though.  The oxy-hydrogen fires are quite slow to heat up the quartz, and recent methods involve ionising the argon gas which is flushed over the electrodes to form a plasma torch, rather similar to the flame found in an atomic absorption spectrometer.  This method is much faster and cheaper to operate than traditional fires, but a large capital expenditure is required to construct the machinery."

						"汞灯是第一种被大规模生产用于一般照明应用的金属蒸气光源，直到今天，它仍然是全球生产量最大的放电灯之一。在欧洲，由于其相对效率较低，且与其他光源相比光通量衰减较快，它已经不再流行。然而，在美洲和亚洲国家，其系统成本低、寿命长、色温高，使其仍然是户外照明的理想光源。图 1 展示了一种典型的现代高压汞灯的构造。",
						"灯的核心是一个由石英制成的弧管，两端各有一个钨电极。管内含有几毫克汞和大约 25-50 托的纯氩气，作为缓冲气体，在灯升温时承载放电，产生热量使汞汽化并进入放电。",
						"在其中一个主电极旁边放置了一个辅助启动电极，以方便灯的点燃。当灯首次通电时，整个开路电压都施加在弧管两端。电极之间的距离很大，因此产生的电压梯度不足以使气体填充物电离。然而，相同的电压也通过一个小电阻施加在一个电极和辅助电极之间。这两个电极之间的距离要小得多，电压梯度足够高，足以发生电离。一个小的放电击穿，10-30kW 的串联电阻限制电流约为正常灯电流的千分之一。一旦在弧管中产生了自由电子、离子和光子，那么在主电极之间击穿放电就变得非常容易。放电会迅速完成这一转变，因为它可以绕过启动电阻，主电极之间没有电阻。有些灯，特别是高功率型号，通常在每个主电极旁边都有两个辅助电极，并通过电阻连接到弧管的另一端。在设计用于寒冷环境的汞灯中，这也是标准做法。",
						"当灯升温且汞完全汽化后，放电在压力从最小型号的 18 巴到最大型号的 2 巴不等的未饱和汞蒸气中进行。弧光发出汞的特征绿色、黄色和紫色谱线，还有相当数量的不可见长波紫外线（365nm），以及一系列更短的波长。在最早的灯中，外灯泡是透明的，这种不可见的紫外辐射完全被浪费了。如今，外灯泡内涂有一层薄薄的荧光粉，可将紫外线转化为可见光，通常是在汞输出不足的光谱红端，以改善这种光源的显色性能。",
						"外灯泡内充有氮气或氮气 - 氩气混合物，有时也充有二氧化碳，既可以防止弧管密封处氧化，又能减缓某些荧光粉的退化速度。对于 50 瓦及以下的低功率灯，一些制造商采用真空或富含氩气的环境，因为它提供了更好的隔热效果，最大限度地减少了传导和对流热损失，这些热损失对于如此小的弧管来说可能会变得相当可观，从而使其能够更快地达到全强度。在专为极寒环境设计的特殊灯中，也采用真空或至少降低气压，其目的同样是提供更好的隔热效果，使弧管能够更快地升温。对于小型或寒冷环境用灯，通常还会在电极后面涂上铂或金的反光涂层，以进一步减少热损失，帮助它们更快地运行。",
						"与其他常见放电灯相比，汞蒸气光源的光效最低。但在其 100 年的发展过程中，材料发生了许多变化，确保了每隔几年性能就会有所提升，直到 20 世纪 80 年代，普通照明灯的进一步开发实际上已经停止。然而，2003 年，飞利浦在欧洲推出了新型 HPL - 4 灯，实现了显著的性能提升。",
						"图 2 下方比较了汞灯与其他光源在光效方面的技术进步。每瓦流明只是灯性能的一个方面，汞灯还有其他优势 - 其显色性能远优于大多数钠产品，而且由于简单的灯设计和基本的控制设备要求，其系统成本极低，即使在当今的一些新安装项目中也有市场。"

						"汞放电的光效与其工作时的蒸气压直接相关，下图 3 详细说明了某种特定灯设计的精确关系。最初的灯在相对较低的压力下工作，低于 1 托，光效为 17.9 lm/W，位于下图右侧的 B 点附近，因此很明显，光效还有很大的提升空间。",
						"此处的数据与直径为 27 毫米的管有关，放电电流保持在 4 安培（Krefft &amp; Summerer，1934）。对于每种灯，精确的数值会略有不同，但一般原理在此处得到了说明。",
						"在上图中所示的最低压力（A 点），大部分汞辐射在紫外光谱区域。放电温度较低，仅略高于管壁温度，因此在这种较小的温差下，通过热传导损失的能量很少，紫外光的产生效率很高。然而，可见光谱区域缺乏辐射意味着在这种压力区域工作的灯的光效仅为 10 lm/W 左右。",
						"随着压力的增加，光效也增加，并在 0.1 托（B 点）达到最大值，大约可以达到 20 lm/W。增加的原因是汞在紫外光谱区域的共振线开始出现自吸收，导致可见光谱区域其他线的相对强度增加，因此光效提高。",
						"尽管这种低效的放电乍一看似乎对照明应用特别无用（即使是白炽灯也能做得更好！），但应记住可以使用荧光粉将不可见的紫外线辐射转换为有用的光。这就是荧光灯的工作原理，在荧光灯中，产生尽可能多的紫外线的放电是非常理想的，因此典型的汞蒸气压约为 0.005 托。在这样的压力下，产生 253.7 纳米紫外线共振线的效率达到最大。然而，在本文中，只有高压汞放电是感兴趣的，关于荧光灯的详细信息将在该类别下找到。",
						"在 0.1 托以上，光效（和紫外线产生）开始再次下降。原因是随着压力的增加，管内的汞原子增多，电子与汞原子之间发生弹性碰撞而导致能量损失的概率增加。见图 4。随着管内汞原子增多，电子从一个电极到另一个电极的路径变得更加曲折，每次碰撞都会损失能量。只有部分碰撞足够强烈，才能导致电离和光的产生，许多碰撞只是导致热量损失。随着压力的升高，这种能量损失机制也随之增加，因此光效开始受到影响。更频繁碰撞的结果是，气体温度在 C 点上升到大约 500°C。由于放电核心如此之热，相当一部分输入的能量通过热传导传递到管壁，这代表了能量的损失，因此光效下降。",
						"有趣的是，在 C 点达到最小值，当压力约为 5 托（但取决于管的直径）时，一个有趣的现像开始出现。在这个压力以上，放电在低压下完全充满整个管径，逐渐开始向管轴收缩，直到最终在放电和管壁之间存在一个环形的暗区（见图 5）。放电从管壁脱离的压力通常被认为是区分所谓的低压灯与其他中压或高压灯的点。",
						"随着压力的增加，放电变得越来越受限制，因此围绕它的暗空间也不断增大。这个暗区为放电和管壁之间提供了一定的热绝缘，并且非常方便地减少了传导热损失的重要性。由于放电得到了更好的绝缘，其温度可以升高，并很快上升到大约 6000°C，这是大多数现代汞灯的工作温度。随着放电的收缩，汞线的相对强度开始增加，但由于没有显著的热损失，光效再次随着压力的增加而提高。",
						"此外，在这一点上，放电核心的温度已经达到了开始出现温度辐射的水平，在汞光谱中出现了少量连续光谱——字面上讲，这种辐射是由加热的汞蒸气的炽热产生的。Küch 和 Retschinsky 在 1906 年首次观察到光效在 C 点之前被认为是最低值之后的增加。",
						"随着压力的持续上升，额外的辐射主要是由于放电的高温造成的——因此可以看到更多的连续光谱辐射。光效最初在 D 点之后迅速上升，但在达到大约 100,000 托（约 130 个大气压）的压力时，渐近地达到一个高值，光效可能高达 70 lm/W。",
						"用于一般照明应用的高压汞灯在 D 点以上的压力范围内工作，通常在 4,000 到 8,000 托（5-10 个大气压）之间。这是低成本一般照明灯能够达到的最大值，离图中显示的最大点并不遥远。虽然在更高压力下光效看似很有吸引力，但这些灯中消耗了大量的能量，需要昂贵的结构和强制冷却，这使得它们只适用于最专业的应用。",
						"汞放电的光谱功率分布很大程度上取决于其工作时的压力。在低压力下，输出主要集中在紫外光区域，但随着压力的增加，紫外光区域的自吸收导致可见光中的绿色、黄色和紫色谱线相对增强。",
						"在超过一个大气压的压力下，光谱中开始出现少量连续光谱辐射，并且随着压力的持续增加，其强度逐渐增强。在下图中 10 个大气压的图中，它仅作为非常低强度的连续光谱勉强可见。通过这种方法增加除主要汞谱线之外的波长，可以显著改善汞放电的显色性能。",
						"在数十个大气压的更高压力下，谱线变宽，这进一步提高了显色质量，但强烈的峰值仍使汞光谱整体呈现蓝绿色调。到这个阶段，连续光谱辐射已显著增加。然而，当压力达到数百个大气压的区域时，峰值开始减弱，光输出逐渐获得更接近白色的有用颜色。",
						"图 6 中的光谱功率分布图表展示了汞光谱在不同压力下可见部分的变化。不过，为了体现低压力下紫外辐射的重要性，第一张图采用了不同的比例尺，以包含更短的波长。"

					description: [
						"自汞灯问世以来，人们就意识到汞放电所辐射的能量中有相当一部分位于紫外光谱区域。在低压放电的情况下，超过一半的总能量以253.7纳米的短波紫外光辐射。高压灯约有10%的能量以365.0纳米的长波紫外光辐射，但也有相当一部分能量以更短的波长辐射。在一般照明应用中，这些紫外光被浪费了，因为人眼看不见。但从一开始人们就知道，存在一种被称为荧光粉的材料，它们能够在紫外光照射下发光，并产生其他颜色的光。",
						"在20世纪30年代中期，人们利用这种材料开发了荧光灯，其原理是将低压汞放电产生的大量短波紫外光转换为可见光。荧光粉涂层被涂在发生汞放电的玻璃管内侧。",
						"然而，为荧光灯开发的荧光粉并不适用于高压汞灯。首先，它们是针对短波紫外光设计的，而高压放电辐射的是短波和长波紫外光的混合光。但更重要的是，高压汞灯的工作温度比低压汞灯高——灯泡壁的温度通常在150到250摄氏度之间。不幸的是，当时已知的荧光粉有一个令人烦恼的特点，即在如此高的工作温度下，它们的效率会大幅降低。",
						"因此，人们很快列出了一套为高压汞灯开发新型荧光粉的要求，即：在较高的灯泡壁温度下具有高效率；在高温和强烈紫外光辐射下具有化学稳定性；对弧管产生的短波和长波紫外光都敏感；尽可能少地吸收光；理想情况下，荧光粉应发出红光以进行颜色校正；整体发光应为白色，与黑体轨迹相差不远。",
						"在早期，人们发现了一些荧光粉能够满足上述一两个标准，但无法满足所有标准！因此，汞荧光灯主要有两种类型——一种是经过颜色校正的，其中荧光粉向光谱中贡献少量红光；另一种是高效率的，其中荧光粉贡献大量的蓝光或绿光。直到20世纪60年代末，这个问题才得到圆满解决，一种满足上述所有要求的新型荧光粉被开发出来。本节的后续页面将介绍在汞灯中使用的五种主要荧光粉家族的发展历程。",
						"在详细考虑每种荧光粉之前，有必要先介绍一些决定它们特性和性能的基本原理。适用于几乎所有发光固体的一个最基本定律是，发射辐射的波长总是比吸收辐射的波长要长。例如，短波紫外光可以转换成任何颜色的光，因为每种颜色的光的波长都比紫外光长得多。短波蓝光也可以类似地转换成长波长的红光。但长波红光无法转换回短波蓝光（除非在特殊情况下）。几乎所有荧光粉都遵循的这一普遍原则被称为斯托克斯定律。",
						"顺便说一下，在本节中介绍各种荧光粉的名称时，会注意到它们几乎总是由宿主材料加上所谓的激活剂组成。激活剂通常是一种微量杂质，有趣的是，通常是激活剂决定了每种荧光粉发光的波长。在书写荧光粉的名称时，标准做法是在宿主材料的化学式后面加上激活剂的化学符号。例如，用锰激活的硫化锌写作ZnS : Mn。"

						"首次将荧光粉涂层应用于汞灯外灯泡是在英国进行的，这是位于温布利的GEC赫斯特研究中心的成果。鉴于该实验室早在几年前就创造了最早的荧光灯和第一款实用的高压汞灯，这一发展显得尤为恰当。开发的目标是找到一种能够产生一些红色光的荧光粉，以补充汞放电所发出的主要是蓝绿色的光，从而提高其显色性能。",
						"这一年是1937年，首款接受新型荧光粉处理的灯是当时最畅销的产品——400W MA中压光源，其弧管由硬玻璃制成。这种发光材料是含铜杂质作为激活剂的硫化锌镉，(Zn,Cd)S:Cu。这种涂层对MA弧管大量逸出的长波紫外光敏感。它能高效地将这种紫外光转换为橙红色光，具体波长取决于锌与镉的比例以及荧光层所涂覆的灯泡壁的物理温度。这一开发成果被称为MAF灯，额外的字母F表示使用了荧光灯泡。一款典型的Osram 400W MAF灯与右侧的普通MA灯并列展示。",
						"人们会立刻注意到，这种灯的形状与普通MA灯所使用的常规细长管状外灯泡截然不同。为了确保荧光粉与弧管之间有足够的距离，使其温度足够低以正常工作，灯泡直径不得不从51毫米增加到165毫米。",
						"最初的灯呈圆柱形，但很快就被修改为如上图和左图所示的锥形等温形式。等温灯泡的形状与400W MA弧管在灯头朝上位置运行时的温度分布相匹配，通过这种方法确保荧光粉在灯泡表面积的大部分区域上温度尽可能均匀，从而略微提高了灯的效率。实际上，通过这种方法，其温度被相当准确地保持在100-150°C的范围内，具体的热分布如图XX所示。",
						"有趣的是，尽管荧光粉有额外的橙色发射，但新型荧光灯的总光通量并不比普通透明灯更高。首先，荧光粉在光谱的红端辐射，而人眼对这一区域的敏感度极低，使得额外的光在对光通量的贡献上并无多大意义。其次，涂层吸收的弧管可见光几乎与它通过紫外光转换生成的光一样多，实际上抵消了增益。按照当今的标准，它的量子效率相当低，将365纳米的长波汞线转换为可见光的效率仅为50%，而在较短的253.7纳米波长处的效率仅为25%。",
						"这种新型涂层很有价值，因为它将红色比例从1%提高到大约4%，这是一个特别重要的增长——这些首批灯所使用的荧光粉的光谱功率分布如图XX所示。然而，所选材料含有如此高的镉含量，以至于它呈现出天然的黄色。因此，其对可见光的透过率相当低，其黄色表明它是一个强烈的蓝光吸收体（这是其紫外吸收带的延伸）。其效果是过滤掉了弧管产生的大部分蓝光，从而增加了剩余绿线的相对强度。",
						"当然，荧光粉发出的橙色光非常有用，但涂层过滤掉的蓝光比它产生的橙光还要多。因此，净光输出明显偏绿色，工作在该光下非常令人不悦，其光谱功率分布如图XX所示。",
						"这一问题在新型MACF灯中得到了部分解决，该灯在弧管中增加了少量镉（通常还有一点锌）作为汞的补充，这两种金属在蓝光区域辐射非常强烈。其效果是通过降低汞绿线的相对强度，将色点部分地移回白色。MACF灯的近似光谱功率分布可与普通的MAF和MA灯在图XX中进行比较。然而，镉作为一种弧管填充材料效率较低，对灯的效率产生了强烈的负面影响，使其下降了约12%。尽管荧光汞镉MACF灯确实提供了更好的显色性，整体呈现更令人愉悦的白色外观，但它们是一种效率较低的创造物。首批涂层灯的价格也很高——即使在1947年，也就是它们推出后的第十年，其价格几乎是普通透明灯的两倍。然而，这种汞灯确实有一个细分市场，并且在可以容忍较高购买和运行成本的领域取得了成功。值得注意的是，这种情况仅发生在欧洲，尤其是英国。在其他地方，效率的损失被认为过于显著，因此涂层汞灯的想法被拒绝，直到很久以后才被重新考虑。",
						"然而在欧洲，荧光粉的发展仍在继续。下一步出现在1937年，涉及将类似的涂层应用于使用石英弧管的80W和125W高压MB型低功率灯——此次开发由荷兰的飞利浦公司牵头，GEC于1939年紧随其后。鉴于石英弧管在更高压力下运行，并且自然产生比玻璃版本更多的红光，因此所需的色度校正程度并不大，可以使用更薄、更高效的涂层。此外，石英能够透过玻璃弧管所不透明的短波紫外光，这种辐射的存在意味着只要具有所需的高温稳定性，一些为荧光灯开发的荧光粉也可以被采用。",
						"因此，为首批MBF灯开发了一种新型荧光粉混合物。它基于与MA灯中使用的相同(Zn,Cd)S:Cu的更薄一层，并增加了一种发出蓝光的成分，以弥补原始荧光粉的黄色。这种新成分也是基于硫化锌，但激活剂是银而不是铜，即ZnS:Ag，这种替代导致了荧光颜色的变化。因此，MA弧管所需的镉添加物可以被省略，MBF灯能够实现与未涂层MB型灯几乎相同的光效。对于被涂层吸收的每一流明光，它几乎重新辐射出一橙色+蓝色光流明，使其成为一种效率较高且在当时具有相当好的显色性的光源。",
						"顺便说一下，与MAF灯一样，MBF灯的外灯泡尺寸也必须增大，以使荧光粉涂层保持足够凉爽以获得良好性能。新的银激活荧光粉对温度特别敏感，而MAF灯可以承受高达175°C的温度，MBF型灯的实际极限大约是100-125°C。因此，80W灯的直径从80毫米增加到110毫米，而125W尺寸的灯从90毫米增加到130毫米。传统上，这些灯都配备了标准的3针卡口或E27爱迪生螺口，但从机械角度来看，在如此大的灯泡上安装如此小的灯头是不合理的，否则会有很多灯泡破裂的情况发生。因此，决定为新的125W尺寸灯提供大型E40爱迪生螺口，用于新安装。",
						"新型MBF灯在英国取得了巨大成功，事实上，如此成功以至于20世纪40年代低功率汞荧光灯的繁荣迹象至今仍然存在。尽管汞灯现在已经缩小到更紧凑的尺寸，但今天的125W灯仍然提供现在明显过大的E40s大螺口。令人惊讶的是，仍有足够大的20世纪40年代旧灯具安装基数，足以证明为更换目的制造这种灯头类型的新灯是合理的！令人惊讶的是，MBF灯仍然没有在英国以外广泛被接受，也许是因为其色彩质量并不出色，不值得这些灯所要求的相当高的价格。因此，最早的MBF灯的发展主要在当时的英国汞灯制造商中最为活跃——英国通用电气公司、Osram-GEC、都市维克斯公司、爱迪生-斯旺电气公司、西门子兄弟公司、飞利浦英国公司和克伦顿-帕金森先生公司。"

						"汞灯的发展在20世纪40年代末发生了重大转变，当时开发出了一种令人惊叹的新荧光粉，即以锰激活的镁锗酸盐（Mg2GeO4:Mn）为基础。这种材料的关键特性是其温度特性，使其成为涂覆在高压汞灯外罩上的荧光粉极为有用。",
						"人们会记得，传统上，荧光粉在达到更高温度时往往会失去效率。因此，第一批带有硫化物荧光粉的汞荧光灯必须制造成非常大的灯泡，以尽可能降低荧光粉的温度。然而，镁锗酸盐在300°C的温度下效率达到峰值——这正是汞灯外灯泡的运行温度。它在高温下也能长期保持稳定，因此可以制造出在其整个使用寿命中荧光粉保持高效率的灯。",
						"自1936年以来，人们就知道Mg2GeO4:Mn具有强烈的红色荧光。这种荧光粉是由Humboldt Leverenz在无线电电话公司（现为GE的NBC电视公司）发明的，他打算将其作为公司阴极射线管荧光屏的更耐用涂层（Leverenz, 1936）。当时，它是一种效率较低但非常耐用的红色光生成器。然后在1947年，人们发现通过添加过量的MgO，可以制造出效率高出五倍的荧光粉（Patten & Williams, 1947）。但真正的突破发生在1950年，当时西屋公司的Luke Thorington进一步改进了这种材料，使其成为汞灯荧光粉的合适材料。",
						"他发现，如果在组成4 MgO.GeO2:Mn中用氟化镁MgF2替代部分MgO（0.5摩尔），那么光输出可以再次加倍（Thorington, 1950）。人们认为氟的存在使得制造荧光粉的成分反应更加彻底，从而产生了新的材料氟化镁锗酸盐MgFGeO4:Mn。这种材料的高效率、热稳定性和强烈的红色辐射（峰值在658nm）使其在近二十年间成为主要的汞灯荧光粉。尽管具有热稳定性，但在更高温度下，荧光颜色仍会向橙色偏移，因此仍希望将灯泡壁温度保持在较低水平，当然不能超过200-250°C。典型灯运行温度下的光谱发射如图XX所示。",
						"当然，首先利用这种新荧光粉的灯是由其发明者西屋公司在1950年左右推出的。它们使红色比例大幅增加了高达7%，几乎再次将早期英国使用硫化物荧光粉所达到的红色含量翻倍。使用这种荧光粉制造的灯的光谱功率分布如图XX所示。尽管增加了红色荧光，但光通量的增加仍然几乎可以忽略不计。尽管氟化镁锗酸盐的颜色没有早期硫化物那么强烈，但它仍然带有一点偏黄的白色。涂层也必须比早期硫化物涂得稍厚一些，因此再次，涂层吸收的光和它产生的额外光一样多。",
						"这种略微的黄色色调是由于在420nm左右吸收蓝光造成的，再次消耗了一些由汞弧产生的光，尽管吸收的量比早期材料要少得多。然而，这种蓝光吸收仍然足以使带有这种涂层的灯发出的光带有一点非常轻微的绿色色调。蓝光吸收在更高运行温度下也会增加，因此尽管这种荧光粉具有高温稳定性，但仍希望保持其温度较低。不过，蓝光吸收量足够小，以至于在大多数应用中，这种绿色色调被认为是可接受的，就像白炽灯发出的光看起来有点偏黄色一样。",
						"这种荧光粉主要是通过MgO、MgF2和GeO2在高温下反应，并添加少量激活剂Mn来制备的。成品材料的性能高度依赖于精确的烧结时间和温度，这与大多数荧光粉的情况一样。实际所需的烧结时间和温度取决于原材料的起始粒径，但一般来说，最佳的荧光粉是在1100°C到1200°C的温度下烧结八小时后获得的。",
						"在烧结过程中，随着反应的进行，颗粒会不断长大。温度越高、烧结时间越长，颗粒就越大，这对于最终的高效率荧光粉是有益的。顺便说一下，还发现使用封闭坩埚烧结荧光粉非常有益，这会导致更粗大的颗粒结构。当使用开放式坩埚时，氟的损失速度相当快，而氟是颗粒生长中的活性剂，因此保持其浓度高是有益的，封闭坩埚在这方面有很大帮助。",
						"粗大的大颗粒结构的重要性很容易理解。如果颗粒大，那么可以涂上相对较厚的涂层，但涂层内的光吸收量小——这是因为光吸收主要发生在颗粒与颗粒之间的边界上，如果颗粒更大，那么边界就更少，因此光吸收将减少。"

						"就在卢克·索林顿（Luke Thorington）在美国西屋公司完善氟化镁锗酸盐荧光粉的同时，奥地利格拉茨的特拉文茨克（Travnicek）先生向荷兰埃因霍温的飞利浦实验室介绍了一种极为相似的材料。这种材料是四价锰激活的镁砷酸盐，化学式为6MgO.As2O5:Mn4+，而此前几年飞利浦已在四价锰荧光粉的制备方面积累了丰富的经验。此前，该公司曾寄希望于一种以镁钛酸盐为基础、采用相同激活剂的荧光粉，该材料具有非常理想的红色发光特性，但遗憾的是，其量子效率无法提高到足以作为汞灯荧光粉使用的水平。",
						"埃因霍温的荧光粉团队很快便将其钛酸盐工艺调整为研究砷酸盐，而这种材料最终促使飞利浦决定将HPL荧光汞灯投入大规模生产。（顺便说一下，在荷兰光源术语中，MB型灯具被称为HP型，而其MBF型荧光对应产品则被归类为HPL型。H代表汞，P代表高压，L代表荧光。）",
						"这种镁砷酸盐荧光粉的特性对于其在公司HPL/MBF产品中的应用极为有利。其荧光呈明亮的红色，在656纳米处达到尖锐峰值（见图XX），它能够吸收汞弧管发出的全部紫外光，其量子效率对于长波和短波紫外激发均为75%，而且其效率能够稳定保持至300摄氏度（见图XX）。它最初显现的一个明显缺点是，其对紫外光的非常宽广的吸收略微延伸至可见光谱，因此会吸收一些蓝光，使荧光粉呈现出淡淡的黄色。不过，这比早期荧光粉的情况要好得多，砷酸盐灯具的色光输出绝不会呈现出绿色。",
						"图XX - 砷酸盐发光特性 图XX - 温度稳定性",
						"此前，飞利浦仅基于早期硫化物荧光粉的发展成果少量生产过HPL灯具。但从1950年开始，该公司开始销售涂覆有砷酸盐荧光粉的汞荧光灯，这种荧光粉被证明是一项非常宝贵的资产。全球其他灯具制造商不得不采用西屋公司的氟化镁锗酸盐材料，并受制于这一来源，而飞利浦则能够自由地基于自身的发展成果制造灯具。飞利浦新型灯具的红色比例为7.5% - 9%，略高于采用氟化镁锗酸盐时能够达到的7%，而且由于锗是一种非常昂贵的原材料，飞利浦荧光粉的价格也要便宜四倍左右。荧光粉涂层的厚度被选定为能够使涂覆灯具发出与透明版本相同的光通量。这种涂层本可以做得更厚一些，从而使荧光粉吸收弧管产生的全部紫外光，并发出更多的红光，但在此类厚度下，蓝光吸收会成为一个问题，从而使色点向绿色偏移。",
						"然而，在一开始，不幸的是人们发现，镁砷酸盐在其被应用的HPL灯具使用寿命期间效率急剧下降，红色比例迅速降低。尽管其他荧光粉因缺乏耐用性而不得不被放弃，但飞利浦的一些巧妙想法使工程师们能够通过一种非常简单的方法克服这一问题。",
						"人们确定，四价锰激活剂极小的浓度部分被还原为二价锰，这发生在充满氮气的汞灯外罩内存在的微弱还原气氛中。因此，实验人员对含有外罩内氮气填充物中微量氧气的新灯进行了实验，新的氧化气氛理论上足以防止四价锰被还原。事实证明，当氮气填充物中含有0.3% - 0.5%的氧气时，在整个灯具使用寿命期间，荧光粉的红光辐射不会下降。",
						"然而，汞灯外罩最初被充满氮气是事出有因的——因为即使是最微小的氧气痕迹也足以导致钼箔封口氧化，而钼箔封口是用于将电流传导至弧管石英中的。在掺杂氧气的灯具中，封口会氧化、膨胀，并在仅运行数十小时后就会使弧管破裂。",
						"可以通过简单地增加封口长度来降低钼箔封口外端的温度，从而解决这一问题。事实上，采用这种方法确实制造出了良好的灯具，封口温度从500摄氏度降低到了250摄氏度以下的安全区域，但自动生产设备很难制造出这种长封口。因此，长封口灯具并不是解决这一问题的可行方案。",
						"之所以在灯具中使用0.3% - 0.5%的氧气，是因为在使用寿命期间，灯具内的各种金属部件也会被氧化，并通过吸气剂作用与氧气结合，因此一开始必须提供足够的氧气以维持整个灯具使用寿命。遗憾的是，所需的量如此之高，以至于会导致封口被氧化。正是基于这一认识，飞利浦想出了一个巧妙的解决方案——填充一种气体，这种气体会在内部紫外光的作用下非常缓慢地分解，持续提供刚好足以保护荧光粉的氧气，但又不至于使封口被氧化。所选气体为二氧化碳。",
						"人们发现，0.5托的二氧化碳填充量为保护荧光粉提供了充足的氧气来源。然而，这种压力相当低，导致弧管的运行温度比通常情况下要高一些——此前使用的是500托的氮气填充压力，这提供了足够高的热导率和对流损失，以维持弧管在正确的温度。非常幸运的是，人们发现将二氧化碳压力提高到类似水平并无不良影响，而且随着二氧化碳压力的增加，氧气的分压并不会升高。原因是，由于二氧化碳分解所产生的CO + O2的体积大约比二氧化碳本身的体积大50%，因此在灯泡中增加二氧化碳压力实际上会导致分解速率降低，氧气分压减少。",
						"在后续工作中，人们发现通过用部分氧化锂（Li2O）替换氧化镁（MgO）原材料，可以抑制四价锰激活剂的还原。这提高了材料的紫外光和高温稳定性，并允许放弃原本微妙平衡的二氧化碳填充系统，转而采用最初且更便宜的氮气。一个有趣的衍生结果是，掺入锂也略微改变了材料各个发射峰的高度。",
						"人们发现，荧光强度与MgO/As2O5的比例密切相关，以至于对应于磷酸盐（3MgO.As2O5:Mn4+）的组成实际上几乎不发光。它是一个强大的紫外光吸收体，但就是不发光。增加氧化镁的浓度会导致荧光强度增加，直至在6MgO.As2O5:Mn4+处达到最大值，而所有灯具中采用的正是这一组成。",
						"这种荧光粉的制造公差相当关键。MgO添加不足会导致上述非发光紫外光吸收磷酸盐相的形成，显著降低荧光。而添加过量的MgO则只会导致成品中该化合物过量。它不是紫外光吸收体，因此荧光下降的速率不像添加不足时那么严重，但仍然会因额外的散射而减弱。",
						"在生产过程中，部分镁以氟化镁（MgF2）的形式添加，这加快了反应速率，就像在氟化镁锗酸盐中一样。对于那种荧光粉来说，它可以使荧光强度翻倍，但对于镁砷酸盐来说，它只是增加了材料的耐久性，以确保荧光粉在灯具使用寿命期间不会失去荧光强度。"

						"与用于汞灯的其他荧光粉不同，英国欧司朗 - GEC开发的钡 - 锶 - 锂硅酸盐材料发出的荧光包含红色、橙色和蓝色以及这些颜色的中间色调。它由钡锂硅酸盐和锶锂硅酸盐的混合物组成，通过改变每种成分的比例，可以形成具有广泛发光特性的连续固溶体系列。其工作原理与卤磷酸盐材料组非常相似，卤磷酸盐也是由GEC发明的，用于荧光灯管。",
						"这种材料组采用双激活剂。三价铈是主要激活剂，它导致蓝色发射，但同时也会敏化次级激活剂锰。随着锰含量的增加，蓝色发射的强度会降低，而以锰为特征的橙红色发射强度会增加。",
						"如果首先只考虑钡锂硅酸盐成分，锰发射的橙色丰富，但随着锶原子取代钡，这种橙色可以显著变红。这是一个重要的补充，因为当温度升高到灯具工作温度时，发射会向黄色偏移，但当然可以通过从更高的锶浓度开始来最小化这种偏移。",
						"与前面描述的锗酸盐和砷酸盐荧光粉不同，硅酸盐材料几乎完全是雪白色，因此其光吸收率低，灯具效率可以相当高。在360纳米处有一个紫外吸收峰，非常接近汞放电的365纳米辐射，并且在420纳米处几乎完全降至零，因此蓝色吸收非常小。使用最佳材料制造的灯具的色温通常约为4400K，色度坐标为x = 0.36，y = 0.38。与锗酸盐和砷酸盐荧光粉相比，它没有向绿色偏移得那么远，但由于荧光粉的蓝色发射，其色温略高。",
						"传统上，硫化物、锗酸盐和砷酸盐荧光粉是作为硝化纤维素粘合剂中的悬浮液涂覆到玻璃灯泡上的，这曾是涂覆管状荧光灯的标准做法。随后，涂覆的灯泡会在空气中以500°C的温度烘烤以烧掉粘合剂，但对于硅酸盐荧光粉来说，所需的烘烤温度过高。在这种高温下，铈激活剂会在空气中被氧化，对荧光粉的效率产生非常不利的影响。",
						"因此，开发了一种技术，允许灯具制造商将干粉喷涂或撒到之前用稀磷酸膜润湿的灯泡内表面。在惰性气氛中以300°C的较低温度烘烤后，涂层随后被干燥并粘附在灯泡壁上，而不会使铈激活剂降解。",
						"当任何荧光粉被涂覆到灯泡上时，涂层厚度足够厚以吸收所有的紫外光用于转换成可见光是可取的。对于锗酸盐和砷酸盐涂层来说，这是不可能的，因为此时的蓝色吸收会变得如此之高，以至于相对更多的汞绿色线被传输，灯具使其照亮的所有物体都呈现出令人不悦的绿色调。因此，涂层重量必须在约每平方厘米3毫克处妥协，在这个重量下仍然存在一些蓝色吸收。对于硅酸盐荧光粉来说，相同的涂层重量就足以吸收所有的紫外光，并且没有显著的蓝色吸收。这是硅酸盐荧光粉的主要优势之一——它的效率可能并不那么高，但它允许制造出具有更自然白光发射的灯具。",
						"就像飞利浦的镁砷酸盐灯具一样，人们发现硅酸盐灯具的红色比例也会迅速贬值，但同样可以通过二氧化碳气体填充来消除这种现象。其原因从未被确定。在飞利浦灯具中，它通过提供微量的氧气分压来防止四价锰激活剂被还原为二价物种。然而，由于GEC硅酸盐荧光粉的锰激活剂最初是二价的，因此其机制必定不同。此外，已知氧化气氛对铈的主要激活剂是有害的，但似乎由于二氧化碳灯泡填充，它并没有被降解。"

						"用镁调整晶体结构的磷酸锶（Sr,Mg）3（PO4）2：Sn2+是最常用于高光效灯具的材料。其发射峰在室温下位于630纳米，在灯具工作温度下波长会显著变短，但光发射仍然很强。到了330摄氏度，红色发射峰已经移动到570纳米，因此很明显，这些灯具的颜色呈现性能受到了影响。而400瓦的镁锗酸盐灯具的红色比例约为7.5%，磷酸锶灯具只能达到大约5%。",
						"用镁调整的磷酸钙也实现了类似的性能，这种材料受到了一些东欧制造商的青睐。它的效率又略有提高，但红色比例进一步下降到4.4%，实际上并不比最初的MAF型灯具更好。",

						"然而，当钒酸盐涂层在20世纪60年代末问世时，它们在除美国以外的所有国家完全取代了高光效系列汞灯，而美国对老式低效涂层的需求却奇怪地持续了近20年。钒酸盐荧光粉提供了10%更高的光效，显著增强了颜色呈现性能，而且颜色为纯白色，首次满足了汞灯荧光粉的所有要求。"

						"这种荧光粉的红色发射峰集中在615 - 619纳米左右，比锗酸盐和砷酸盐材料以前的深红色658纳米峰的波长要短得多。但由于人眼的光谱敏感性，这仍然被视为红色，而且这是一个人眼更为敏感的波长。由于这种效应，以及新的粉末涂层对其他波长的吸收要低得多，钒酸盐灯具的总光效在同一时间提高了大约10%。",
						"在随后的几年里，氧化钇的问题也得到了克服，如今它已成为一种重要的荧光灯荧光粉。尽管其成本略低，但它从未在汞灯使用中流行起来，所有制造商至今仍继续使用钒酸盐材料，尽管这两种荧光粉的性能大致相同。"

						"1902年，发明家表示：“当考虑到这种光在水银气体中获得时，其效率至少是普通白炽灯的八倍时，就会明白它在红色不重要的地方是有用的，因为操作的经济性将远远补偿被照亮物体的不自然颜色。”\n         通过早期使用荧光材料来改善颜色，给灯周围的反射器涂上玫瑰色染料罗丹明。库珀·休伊特的另一种发明是使用串联连接的碳丝灯作为他的灯的镇流器，这些灯提供了强烈的红色贡献，但确实降低了效率。图9所示的例子是现代水银混合灯的最早祖先。\n          这种光也容易闪烁，因为放电的根源在其沸腾的水银电极上跳动，尽管发明家微调了他的灯几何形状以尽量减少这种情况，但这个问题无法根除。",
						"尽管如此，这种灯在工业照明和照片印刷业务中取得了巨大成功，这两个领域都需要大量的廉价光，而且颜色并不重要。图10展示了一张1908年针对印刷行业的典型广告。\n        然而，由于白炽灯技术的巨大进步，工厂照明市场逐渐失去了对这种灯的青睐。在十年或二十年内，白炽灯发展到了足以对汞灯的唯一优势——其无与伦比的效率构成严重威胁的程度。",
						"库珀·休伊特公司开展了一场大胆的营销活动，常常提出一些相当夸张的说法，即缺乏红色辐射实际上应该被视为一种优势。该公司声称，在白炽灯光谱中的“有害红光”几乎完全导致了在人工光下进行近距离工作时眼睛的疲劳。随后，汞灯被大力推广用于绘图员办公室或需要密切注意书籍和文件的环境中\n        最终，更高效的钨丝灯取代了它在工业照明中的地位，库珀·休伊特灯随后被流放到规模可观的图形艺术行业。其高感光值的刺眼蓝光与当时用于重氮照片印刷工艺的慢乳剂的要求完美匹配。它继续作为一项有利可图的业务，欧洲在更高压力放电方面取得的令人鼓舞的结果重新点燃了人们对用于一般照明的汞灯的兴趣。\n\t\t到1919年，业务和技术发展到了美国通用电气公司无法忽视的程度，该公司收购了库珀·休伊特公司。生产从曼哈顿西29街220号的原始工厂迁出，通用电气在新泽西州霍博肯的大街工厂建立了自己的汞灯部门。随着欧洲继续开发新型灯，通用电气的工厂迅速采用并被其他美国制造商模仿。1934年，一种改进型的库珀·休伊特灯被开发出来，令人惊讶的是，这种灯在通用电气工厂一直生产到1965年。在世界其他地区，欧洲风格的中压和高压汞灯被立即采用，只有在北美，过时的库珀·休伊特灯继续存活了许多年。"

						"这些灯的另一个缺点是它们都含有过量的水银，管内的蒸气总是饱和的。换句话说，灯的温度变化会导致更多或更少的水银蒸发到放电中，随之而来的是放电的电气特性和光输出的变化。环境温度或供应电压的这种变化导致灯的性能在非常广泛的范围内发生不希望的变化。"

						"如果灯具成功点燃，那么电感线圈绕组周围的磁场会迅速恢复，并且仍然足够强大，以保持水银移位器处于开路位置。然而，如果灯具在第一次尝试时没有点燃，移位器会回到其静止位置并再次短路灯具，整个过程会重复进行，直到灯具成功点亮为止。整个自动启动装置的典型接线图如图15所示。",
						"采用外部电极加上辅助水银移位器的系统被证明是非常可靠的。通常会尝试使用油浸式或快速动作断路器作为水银移位器的替代品，但它们被证明是反复无常的，并且并非总是有效。有趣的是，无论哪种装置最快地切断通过它的电流流动，电感线圈都会产生更高的感应电压——高压脉冲的大小当然取决于绕组周围的磁场崩溃的速度。在这里，水银移位器具有优势，这归因于冷水银蒸气的独特快速去电离特性以及其易挥发接触点的散热特性。还观察到移位器越冷，效果越好。在炎热的天气中，移位器本身会含有更大的水银蒸气压力，这导致电路断开速度变慢，灯具点火的可靠性降低（但仍然比任何其他形式的快速动作断路器更可靠）"

						"第一款真正成功在高压下运行的汞灯是由英国通用电气公司在1923-1932年间发明和开发的。尽管该灯在当年稍后被推向市场，但令人惊讶的是，其采用汞蒸气这一事实直到1933年才被公开，当时灯具开始大量供应，竞争对手也纷纷推出自己的同类产品。在那之前，它仅仅被称为“Osira”荧光灯管。按照后来的术语，它被归类为MA灯，“M”代表汞，“A”表示在玻璃管中以中等压力放电运行，且每厘米弧长的功率负载超过十瓦。顺便说一下，Osira这个名字的引入是因为直到第二次世界大战之前，通用电气公司只被授权在其金属丝白炽灯上使用其Osram品牌名称。多年前，德国Osram公司授予了通用电气公司这一权利，因为通用电气公司负责根据Osram的设计在整个英帝国制造和销售金属丝白炽灯——但它只被允许在那些产品上使用该名称。这一限制在第二次世界大战期间被解除，此后，通用电气公司的所有灯具都带有Osram名称。",
						"通用电气公司知道，由于库珀-休伊特和库赫与雷钦斯基生产的灯具的性能，汞灯照明可以是高效的，但这两款产品都不适用于一般照明应用。",
						"1923年，通用电气公司在温布利的赫斯特研究实验室开始了一项研究工作，旨在改进这些粗糙的早期设计，并开发一种新灯，以克服它们的大部分缺点，并作为日常应用中白炽灯的真正替代品，为自己创造一个市场。很快确定，为了实现这样的灯，必须满足以下关键要点：汞蒸气压力至少为一个大气压。整个汞剂量完全蒸发，以提高灯具稳定性。玻璃管能够在至少600°C的温度下连续运行。高发射电极能够承载高灯具电流，持续至少1000小时。一种绝缘方式，以保护放电管免受冷空气的吹拂。紧凑的尺寸，便于其在标准光学系统中使用。",
						"通用电气公司的科学家们推测，这样的灯将达到比钨丝灯高三倍的发光效率，并且其颜色将得到改善，至少适用于街道和工业照明。他们迅速着手设计一款符合这些原理的灯具，以作为当时工业和区域照明的主力——一千瓦白炽灯的令人满意的替代品。在这一时期密集的研究中，还构思了许多其他放电灯，例如荧光灯管和热阴极氖灯的基础，但他们的真正成果在1932年以下面所示的“Osira”汞灯的形式出现。",
						"灯的核心是一个由通用电气公司专门为这种灯开发的新型铝硅酸盐玻璃制成的弧光管。通过改进旧的魏恩尔特阴极，满足了电极要求，它由一种钡、钙和锶硅酸盐的颗粒混合物组成，嵌入在一根厚重的钨丝线圈中。电极之间的间距为182毫米，弧光管的内径为34毫米，其中含有5托的氩气加上几毫克的汞。在运行过程中，整个汞剂量被蒸发，弧光管达到大约550°C的温度，最冷的地方仍然超过360°C，这产生了精确的一个大气压的汞蒸气压力（几乎是实际灯具中曾经实现的四倍）。由于在运行过程中所有的汞都被蒸发，环境温度或供电电压的变化对灯具性能的影响非常小，因为它们不能导致更多的汞被蒸发到放电中。弧光管被安装在一个密封的、充满氮气的管中，以防止冷空气的吹拂影响汞的压力（注意顶部的细管），最终的灯具配备了GES（E40s）螺纹帽，直径为50毫米，长度为300毫米。",
						"这款新型灯具在400瓦的功率下运行，发出14400流明的光，使用寿命为1200小时。因此，它不仅成功地匹配了1000瓦白炽灯的输出，而且在功率消耗不到一半的情况下实现了这一目标——其发光效率为36流明/瓦。高汞蒸气压力确保了尽管光谱仍然完全缺乏任何红色波长，但蓝色强度已经降低到使其颜色适用于街道和工业照明的水平。400瓦MA灯的精确光谱功率分布如右侧图20所示。"

						"1932年6月22日，世界上首次汞蒸气路灯安装被点亮，创造了历史。光源是英国通用电气公司当年开发的Osira 400瓦MA灯，地点位于伦敦的东道，就在该公司赫斯特研究实验室和温布利灯具工厂的外面。灯具是简单的透明玻璃保护罩，没有任何光学控制，但效果特别引人注目。与被替换的1000瓦白炽灯相比，新灯具以2.5倍的效率照亮街道，以惊人的强度将道路笼罩在日光色的光中。",
						"毫不奇怪，这一安装不仅在伦敦市政府引起了相当大的兴趣，而且在整个国家乃至国际上也是如此。来自世界各地的城市工程师纷纷前来目睹这些创新灯具照亮道路的惊人亮度。",
						"这次首次安装只是通用电气公司的一个试验性试验，几个月后就清楚地表明，应该更科学地进行，开发新的灯具以配合Osira灯具产生的高光柱，这些灯具必须垂直燃烧。1933年3月2日，相邻的沃特福德路上投入使用了一个改进的安装（图21）。",
						"在道路的一英里路段上使用了46个单元，并为Osira灯具设计了一种外观高度独特的新型单元——沃特福德路灯具。图21展示了该灯具在白天和夜晚的样子。人们立即注意到，由于光是从高大的垂直发光蒸汽柱中产生，而不是像白炽灯那样来自微小紧凑的光源，因此弧光本身就有助于形成柔和的阴影和良好的扩散。据说整体的能见度相当出色。"

						"MA 灯生产的早期是一个密集的研究和开发时期，工作集中在两个不同的领域——首先，必须找到方法来降低灯的生产技能要求并降低其价格。关于这一主题的主要发展在灯制造部分有解释。其次，人们强烈推动在几乎每一个方面进一步提高灯的性能——这些是本页的主题。",
						"鉴于第一款 400W MA 灯的巨大光效，客户毫不浪费时间地要求不同功率的灯，以扩展应用范围。很快推出了 250W 版本，到 1939 年，一款更大的 650W 型号也投入生产。但客户对这些功率并不满意，他们真正想要的是一个更低的功率，以便用汞灯取代普通的白炽灯。",
						"为了满足这一需求，灯制造商在 1936 年创造了 150W MA 灯，但延迟的原因很快变得明显。其光效因两个原因大幅降低。首先，当制造更小的灯时，弧光的电压降实际上应该被允许降低，但这是无法容忍的，因为它带来了灯电流的增加。这使得镇流器效率很低，因为其绕组在如此高的电流下运行时会因焦耳热而增加损耗。灯的电压不得不保持在一个不方便的高位，需要降低电流以实现更低的功率，这降低了弧光中的功率负荷。图 23 显示了随着功率负荷的降低，灯的光效是如何下降的。",
						"其次，无论灯的功率如何，电极前发生的电气损耗的量级是相似的，因此尽管弧光柱中耗散的功率降低了，但电极损耗基本保持不变，这意味着这些损耗对于较小的灯来说变得更加显著。这一现象在灯电极部分有更详细的解释。因此，任何类型的低功率灯的光效总是会逐渐变差，这一规则适用于所有放电灯。150W MA 灯并没有取得商业成功，只生产了几年。引入更低功率的汞产品不得不等待几年，直到 MB 型灯的发展使其成为可能，并且具有更高的光效，如下一节所述。",
						"与此同时，制造商专注于开发高功率市场，当然，对于更大的灯，光效会更高。1939 年，一款 1000W 灯加入了产品系列（这是一种裸露的弧光管类型），在美国，一款非常长的高电压 3000W 灯很快也出现了（型号 H-9）。它在 535V 下运行，灯电流为 6.25A，弧光长度为 1220mm，管径为 30mm。本质上可以将其视为八个 400W 弧光管首尾相连，由于只有两个电极的功率损耗，而不是八个 400W 灯所使用的十六个电极，因此其功率略低于 8×400W。电压也较低，以考虑只有一对而不是八对电极的电压降。其相当笨拙的尺寸使其仅限于天花板很高的工业照明区域，但其长度在照片冲洗店被发现是一个优势。",
						"在英国，人们关注的是更紧凑尺寸的高功率灯，2500W 型号在许多试验性安装中被使用，但从未大规模推向市场。这些灯具有 52lm/W 的高光效，来自一个更紧凑的弧光，长度为 400mm，管径为 65mm。灯的电压为 145 伏，电流为 18.5 安培。尽管在水平使用时，弧光会在管轴上方约 1/2 英寸处向上弯曲，但由于返回导线产生的磁场，它被阻止与放电管壁接触，该导线固定在弧光管的顶部。图 24 展示了一款实验性的 BTH 2500W 工业泛光灯。",
						"英国 MA 灯系列的一些更常见的技术规格在下表 1 中详细列出。所有数据均与 1950 年为 230/240V 交流电源设计的灯有关。资料来源——电灯制造商协会，电弧灯分会委员会，IX 组灯的内部协议数据。",
						"第一款 MA 灯被严格分类为 MA/V 型，V 表示它们仅适用于垂直向上燃烧。还提供了一种类似的 MA/D 灯，这种类型适用于垂直向下燃烧。区别很简单，弧光管被倒置了，这样其排气管从真空系统密封的地方（即封口）总是在弧光管的上端。原因是这个封口区域内的温度可以稍低一些，汞可以在这里冷凝，结果是它没有全部蒸发到放电中，灯可能无法达到全功率运行。由于热空气上升，将这个封口放置在弧光管的最上端是明智的，这样它不太可能成为一个冷点并干扰灯的性能。",
						"然而，垂直燃烧相当不方便，因为需要复杂的灯具设计来重新引导光线，并将其发送到水平平面上，尤其是对于路灯灯罩。水平燃烧要理想得多，但无法被接受。在 MA 灯中，弧光的中心温度非常高，而外围则要冷得多，这种温差形成了强烈的对流气流。在水平位置时，这些气流足够强大，足以使弧光在其中心向上扫动，使其直接与放电管壁接触。这种升高的温度是无法被接受的，因为放电管玻璃会因内部正压力而变软并向外鼓起。灯很快就会损坏。图 25 展示了这种向上弯曲的照片。",
						"由于弧光本身实际上是一种柔性的导电体，而所有导体都会受到磁场的影响，BTH 想出了一个办法，通过外部电磁铁将弧光强制拉回到放电管的中心附近。通过将这个电磁铁与灯串联，它产生的交替磁场当然会自动与放电电流同步，通过正确放置偏转线圈，它在防止弧光接触放电管壁方面最为有效。这种磁偏转在英国非常受欢迎，此后，大多数路灯灯罩都转向了水平燃烧的灯。",
						"典型的偏转器只消耗大约 3 到 5 瓦，但必须精确定位才能有效，很快就被视为许多灯具的笨重和沉重的附加物。因此，灯制造商将注意力转向制造一种无需偏转器即可水平燃烧的新灯，这导致了 MA/H 型的出现。通过减少每单位弧长的汞量，弧光管中的对流气流速度降低，其效果是最大限度地减少弧光的向上弯曲。正是这种组合以及直径大 2mm 的弧光管导致了 MA/H 灯的推出。然而，这些设计中较低的汞蒸气压力及其较低的电压降意味着它们的光效比垂直燃烧型低约 10%。鉴于可以制造简单的低成本灯具，通过采用更高效的光学系统来弥补灯性能的损失，这种牺牲被认为是值得的。",
						"在 20 世纪 50 年代初，市场上出现了一种新型灯，即 MA/U，它被设计为无需任何偏转线圈即可通用燃烧。这是通过开发一种新型玻璃实现的，其软化温度比原始类型大约高 50°C。此外，弧光长度略微缩短，这减少了它向上弯曲的程度。因此，它可以水平燃烧而不必担心过热。每单位弧长的汞量几乎与第一种 MA/V 型一样多，因此光效很高，因此它能够取代前两种类型的灯。水平光效仍然比垂直光效低 10%，这是由于对流损耗，但它与专门的 MA/H 和 MA/V 灯的性能相匹配，因此能够取代它们。",
						"自汞灯问世以来，人们通过多种方法尝试改进其显色性能。从一开始，GEC 就考虑在汞弧中添加各种其他金属，这些金属会在光谱的红端提供一些辐射，试验了一种含有镉和锌以及汞的灯。这将灯的红光比例从 1% 增加到大约 2%，有效地将少量红光翻倍。然而，这种灯从未以 MA 格式上市——首先，这些添加剂金属在紫外和红外部分的光谱中辐射了许多谱线，汞放电的光效降低了大约 15%。此外，早期添加了这些物质的灯很快就会出现弧光管变黑，无法获得有用的使用寿命。",
						"因此，人们将注意力集中在荧光汞灯上，其中外灯泡的内表面涂有一层荧光物质。理想情况下，这种材料应该吸收紫外波长，并在光谱的红端重新辐射，以改善显色性能。1937 年，一种所谓的 MAF 灯投放市场，其荧光涂层为硫化镉锌。这种灯在与硫化物荧光粉相关的部分中有详细描述。",
						"1935 年，英国西门子兄弟公司的 J.N.奥尔丁顿博士和 W.H.勒马雷夏尔先生（与德国西门子无关）提出了一个替代的、极具创新性的颜色校正解决方案。三十年前，彼得·库珀-休伊特证明了适当功率的普通白炽灯可以成功地用作汞放电的镇流器，它们多余的红光完美地补充了汞放电的蓝光。但正是上述西门子人首次将弧光管和灯丝全部放在一个外灯泡内，创造了第一种不需要外部镇流器并且具有出色显色性能的汞灯。"

						"第一盏 MA 灯只有两个电极，仅用于维持主电弧，别无他用。要使放电管内发生初始击穿并电离填充气体，始终需要高电压梯度，具体电压取决于氩气的充气压力以及放电管的长度与直径之比。当然，氩气压力的选择是为了使击穿电压最低，尽管 MA 灯的长度与直径比相对较低，但由于壁电荷的影响，普通的市电电压本身不足以点燃放电。实际上，如果不用辅助方法降低这个值，大多数 400W 的 MA 灯需要 300-500V 的脉冲来启动放电。在最初的 MA 灯实验安装中，电压脉冲是由控制电路中包含的一个小型特斯拉线圈提供的。这种方法虽然简单，但如果每个灯具都安装一个特斯拉变压器，将会增加很大的成本和不便，所以在第一次商业安装 MA 汞灯之前就被取代了。",
						"通过将第三个小型电极放置在其中一个主电极的非常近处，由于这两个电极之间的间隙很小，因此它们之间的电压梯度很高，填充气体更容易被击穿，从而可以显著降低灯的启动电压。标准方法是在弧管的帽端主电极旁边直接放置一根简单的钨丝或钼丝。它通过一个高电阻（大约 50 kW）连接到管另一端的主电极。其工作原理与前面已经描述的自启动库珀 - 厄威特灯完全相同。然而在 MA 的情况下，启动电极在弧管内部，所以不需要高电压的启动 - 主电极与相邻辅助电极之间的电离在正常工作电压下就可以发生，有些情况下灯的启动电压可以降低到 100V 甚至更低。这与通常的 240V 市电电压之间有足够的安全裕度，以确保即使在市电电压下降、寒冷的环境中或灯的使用寿命后期（启动电压总是会略有上升）时，也总是能够启动。",
						"在启动电极和旁边的主电极之间很容易引发一个小的辉光放电，电阻将放电电流限制在正常灯电流的大约千分之一。一旦在辅助电极周围发生电离，管子就会导电，电弧几乎瞬间在两个主电极之间移动，因为这条路径上没有电阻。同样的原理至今仍在所有现代汞灯和许多金属卤化物灯中使用。图 26 显示了自启动 MA 弧管和连接到辅助电极的接线布置。",
						"在早期，增加第三个辅助电极被认为相当麻烦，增加了灯的成本和技术复杂性，并且由于多了一个玻璃 - 金属密封，弧管破裂的可能性更大，导致灯的设计不可靠。因此，许多实验都在进行外部启动电极的研究，英国西门子和美国通用电气是这一领域的主要研究者。",
						"在最简单的设计中，几圈细电线绕在弧管的一端，并连接到另一端的电极。图 27 展示了西门子最早的设计之一。后来，通过将一片细金属网绕在管子的外面，并将其焊接在弧管支撑框架上，该框架连接到另一端的主电极，从而改进了这种设计。",
						"这样做的效果是中和了通常使启动电压高于预期的所谓“栅格效应”，这种效应是由弧管壁上的电荷引起的。外部电极能够通过与内部主电极之间的电容在放电管内产生电离。这大大降低了所需的启动电压，使其通常可以达到市电供电的水平。然而，在普通的市电频率 50-60Hz 下，它并不完全有效，内部电极仍然更可靠。因此，外部启动电极只广泛用于在高频供电下运行的灯具，如 MBM 煤矿灯，或者用于设计在高供电电压下运行的灯具，如飞利浦的第一盏 MB 灯。"

						"开灯后，放电最初在氩气和低压汞的环境中发生。在最初的几分钟内，光输出微乎其微，颜色明显偏蓝。当汞蒸气压力低时，可见光产生的效率非常低，因为紫外光谱线主导了光谱。低压状态的另一个特征是，放电以弥漫的辉光充满整个弧管直径，光效大约为 3 lm/W（见图 28）。",
						"由于此时汞蒸气压力非常低（大约 0.002 托），放电的电气特性主要由氩气填充决定。电阻几乎为零，因此弧上的电压降很低，通常约为 20 伏，而电流则在实际上相当于短路条件下，镇流器能够提供的电流值很高。通常，启动电流约为正常灯电流的 1.7 倍。对于 400 瓦的灯，启动电流为 5.5 到 6 安，弧管内的功率约为 100 瓦。",
						"当然，如此高的电流必须由电极承载，而在点火后的这段时间尤其具有破坏性。这就是频繁开关会降低灯寿命的原因。",
						"随着时间推移，这种放电产生的热量开始使部分汞剂量蒸发。其效果是使弧管上的电压降增加，灯内消耗的功率也随之增加，从而使灯的瓦数上升。由于管内消耗的功率较低，电压的上升起初较为缓慢，但随着更多汞的蒸发，功率增加，剩余的汞也更快地蒸发，同时使灯的电压上升。灯的瓦数上升的同时，光通量也随之增加。同样，随着灯的电压上升，电流逐渐降至正常运行值，从而减轻了电极的负荷。",
						"一旦所有的汞都蒸发完毕，随后的电压降几乎保持不变。弧管仍继续升温，由于没有更多的汞可供蒸发，已经蒸发的汞量则被认为进入了过热状态。瓦数继续略有上升，进一步提高了汞的压力，改善了光效和颜色特性。最终运行压力由弧管最冷点的温度决定，通常就在电极的后方。因此，希望尽量缩短电极后部与弧管末端之间的间隙。此处的确切间隙受到玻璃强度的限制，因为如果玻璃 - 金属密封区域过热，玻璃会破裂。实际上可达到的最高温度为 360°C，这对应于精确的 1 个大气压的汞蒸气压力。在如此高的压力下，弧被收缩成一条明亮的细线，如图 28 所清楚显示的那样。",
						"在 MA 灯的最初设计中，整个启动过程大约需要 9 分钟，但对于后来的型号有所缩短。如果能使汞蒸气压力更快上升，灯就能更快启动，在后来的灯中，这是通过在电极后方的弧管末端涂上一层反射热的铂镜来实现的，以防止此处的热量损失。这种涂层总是以氯铂酸的形式涂上，而氯铂酸恰好能溶于薰衣草油，将这种混合物在空气中加热 30 分钟至大约 500°C，就能分解成一层光亮的金属膜。其效果是将 400 瓦灯的启动时间缩短至大约 6 分钟，250 瓦灯缩短至 7 分钟。更快的启动不仅出于实际原因有利，而且因为它能更快地使电极脱离高负荷状态，从而最大限度地延长其使用寿命，同时降低弧管发黑的速度。铂涂层的位置如图 29 所示。",
						"下面的图 30 展示了一张图表，显示了 MA 型灯在升温至全功率时电压、电流、瓦数和光通量的变化情况。如果市电供电中断，电弧熄灭，那么灯不能立即重新点燃，因为随着压力的升高，汞蒸气的启动电压会急剧上升。要立即重新点燃一只热的 400 瓦 MA 灯，需要 5000 到 10000 伏的电压。通常需要 10 分钟，灯才能冷却到市电电压足够高以重新点燃它的程度。然后还需要一段时间，灯才能重新升至全强度。"

						"玻璃技术的发展，这是 GEC 拥有巨大专长的领域，最终使 MA 灯成为可能。在库珀 - 厄威特灯中使用了硼硅酸盐玻璃，但这种玻璃不能在特别高的温度下运行，因此无法产生高汞压力。从库奇和雷钦斯基的发展演变而来的 Spanner 和 Bastian 灯中，人们已经知道了石英玻璃，尽管它在耐火性能方面非常合适，但其热膨胀系数如此之低，以至于人们不知道有什么令人满意的方法可以将金属导体密封在其中。所采用的技术都非常繁琐，而且经常会出现破裂或泄漏的情况，因此石英灯只能用于不需要依赖它们作为光源的场合，主要限于医疗和科学应用。",
						"因此，位于 Lemington 的 GEC 玻璃厂和 Wembley 的玻璃技术专家们承担起了开发一种比硼硅酸盐更耐火、但仍然具有高热膨胀系数以便能够将金属丝密封在其中的玻璃的任务。它还要求在将要运行的高温下具有高电阻率，并且能够抵御过热的汞蒸气和来自电极的氧化物涂层的任何化学侵蚀。这占据了开发 MA 灯所花费的大部分时间，但取得了巨大的成功。专门为此应用开发了一个称为铝硅酸盐的新玻璃家族，从而产生了 GEC 流行的 H26X 玻璃类型。",
						"本质上，硼硅酸盐玻璃的主要成分，即硼酸氧化物，被氧化铝取代了。这一变化使软化温度关键性地提高了 200°C，而且热膨胀系数实际上略微高于硼硅酸盐。人们发现它非常适合直接密封到轻微氧化的钼丝上。较高的膨胀系数令人尴尬地使玻璃对热冲击更加敏感，考虑到这一点，每次将玻璃加热至软化温度时，都必须引入延长的退火时间表。在这方面，铝硅酸盐或许是玻璃技术专家最讨厌的材料，似乎你只要对一批成品灯皱皱眉，它们就会立即破裂！尽管如此，只要小心，就可以对其进行加工，并且找到了可靠地将钼导体密封在其中的方法。",
						"在 Osram 展示了 Osira 灯之后不久，英国透平电气公司开始积极生产铝硅酸盐玻璃，并很快在切斯特菲尔德玻璃厂生产自己的 C14 级玻璃。其热膨胀系数为 37×10⁻⁷ 米/°C，软化温度为 730°C，这种玻璃由 58.5% 的二氧化硅、22.5% 的氧化铝、3.0% 的氧化硼、15.2% 的镁、钡和钙的氧化物以及 0.8% 的钠和钾的氧化物组成。",
						"在随后的几年里，BTH 为提高其铝硅酸盐玻璃的软化温度投入了巨大的努力，BTH 研究实验室在罗格比的 J.E. Stanworth 和 A.E. Dale 所做的工作尤其重要。许多涵盖这一重要发展时期的重要的技术论文都是由这些科学家撰写的。在 20 世纪 40 年代末，推出了新的切斯特菲尔德 C37 玻璃，其软化温度提高到了 760°C，这使得灯的光效得以进一步提高。1950 年，C46 玻璃问世，其性能更高，软化温度达到了 775°C。这一最后的发展很重要，因为这意味着，有史以来第一次，可以制造出适合在任何方向上通用燃烧的高效灯。以前，当灯水平燃烧时，由于对流气流导致电弧向上弯曲，需要使用外部磁性偏转器，以防止电弧过热并损坏弧管。直到 C46 玻璃问世之前，专门设计用于水平操作的特殊灯，其弧管直径较大，汞剂量较少，这意味着它们的光效略有下降。然而，新的更硬的 C46 玻璃刚刚能够承受标准图案水平燃烧灯中存在的更高壁温，于是可以销售一种通用燃烧灯，这种灯在水平或垂直方向上都能提供完整的效率。",
						"在美国，铝硅酸盐的生产首先被通用电气公司在 1934 年采用，该公司与 BTH 有一项完整的专利许可协议，因此两家公司可以立即利用对方的开发成果。纽约的康宁玻璃公司很快也开始生产类似的铝硅酸盐玻璃，这些玻璃被供应给西屋电气和西凡尼亚公司，使这些公司也能够进入汞灯行业。"

						"将高电流注入这种灯的唯一实际方法是通过热阴极，由于热电子发射的原理，热阴极在其升高的工作温度下会发射出大量的电子。Osram-GEC 一直在研究热阴极，试图提高线性氖灯和荧光灯的功率密度，该公司还在其位于伦敦哈默史密斯的马可尼 - 奥斯拉姆电子管厂（与灯厂共用同一地点）中使用类似的电极制造无线电电子管和其他电子管。在这个领域并不缺乏知识，很快开发出了一种满足汞灯特别严格要求的新阴极。",
						"如果使用纯加热钨丝，它会运行得非常热，并且会迅速蒸发和飞溅，使弧管变黑并吸收灯产生的大部分光线。这是因为钨具有高“功函数”，换句话说，需要大量的能量才能从其表面发射电子，这些能量被浪费为热量，并没有对灯的光输出做出贡献。这导致在发射负电子并接收正离子的阴极前方立即出现较大的电压梯度。高电场强度，称为阴极降，加速这些离子以高速撞击电极，由于它们的质量很大，它们以相当大的力量撞击电极，通过溅射物理地破坏电极，并进一步加剧上述提到的弧管发黑问题。灯的使用寿命取决于电极逐渐被这种持续过程消除的速度。因此，电极的设计必须使其能够在遭受尽可能少的损坏的情况下接收这些离子。实现这一点的方法是降低电极的功函数，使其能够自由发射电子，其前方的电压降则被最小化，离子可以以最小的冲击被接收。这一原理在图 31 中以示意图的形式进行了说明。",
						"其他金属的功函数低于钨，但它们并不像钨那样耐火，在灯内的高温下无法承受而不熔化或物理蒸发，这同样会导致发黑问题。最终通过改进 1904 年在德国开发的旧温尔特阴极来满足电极要求。温尔特发现，如果在加热的导线上涂上一层氧化钡，其热电子发射会大大增加。现在已知这是由于在导线表面形成了一层单原子厚的钡金属层，这些涂层具有极低的功函数值。在现代电极中，通常使用氧化钡与锶和钙的氧化物一起使用，这些氧化物的作用是降低钡的蒸发速率。通常也使用氧化钍来进一步降低功函数。",

						"为了便于制造这种电极，电子发射颗粒从未以原始金属氧化物的形式插入。在第一盏奥斯拉姆灯中，颗粒是由钡 - 锶 - 钙硅酸盐混合而成的，在此后制造的几乎所有灯中，都使用了金属碳酸盐。在这些化合物对阴极产生任何益处之前，它们必须首先被转化为氧化物，并且通过一个称为电极激活的过程，在钨丝线圈表面形成一层原始金属的单层。",
						"通常的做法是在灯还在排气机上时将电极加热到非常高的温度 - 要么使用射频振荡器进行感应加热，要么如果电极的形状允许，就通过电极本身通入大电流。或者，电极也可以通过在弧管内激发高电流交流电弧产生的电子轰击来激活，或者两种方法结合使用。高温处理将金属碳酸盐或硅酸盐分解为氧化物，直到在过程中释放的所有气体都被连接到弧管上的真空泵完全抽出为止。在这种高真空下，氧化物会部分还原，形成自由的钡金属，这些金属扩散到钨电极表面，从而形成了对良好电子发射至关重要的单层。此后，激活的电极不得与任何空气或氧气接触，因为这会立即破坏单层并使电极失效，使其永久失去作用。",
						"在正常运行的灯中，单层的蒸发和颗粒内部新鲜金属的扩散同时持续发生。每种过程的速率取决于电极的工作温度，重要的是要为每种灯设计电极，使其工作温度能够使每种过程的速率完美平衡。如果单层蒸发得太快，电极将失去活性，失去发射能力，灯将失效。如果新鲜材料从颗粒中扩散得太快，那么它也会像被产生出来一样迅速蒸发掉，再次导致弧管发黑和颗粒过早耗尽，结果灯也会提前失效。",
						"这一领域的许多科学研究工作是在英国普雷斯顿的西门子电气灯具和供应公司（与德国西门子无关）的 J.N.奥尔丁顿博士的指导下进行的。他的研究实验室系统地测试了数百种不同的电极布置和灯的化学成分，以获得更长、更高效的灯寿命。西门子所做的工作的范围很容易通过一个简单的事实来识别，即如今很少会遇到两盏结构相同的西门子 MA 灯，几乎所有的灯都有不同的电极、启动辅助装置或组装方法。特别是，许多空心阴极设计以及不同的电子发射材料都得到了研究，所有这些研究的目的都是为了降低灯的启动电压、减少弧管发黑的速率和延长电极寿命。",
						"另一种值得一提的电极是 BTH 使用的类型，它在发射颗粒中也加入了氧化钍。这种物质具有轻微的放射性，有助于在放电管内引起电离，从而降低了所需的启动电压。"

						"最初的 Osira 灯具完全是手工制作的，最初基本上只是用一根普通的玻璃管。这根管子的一端会被封成圆顶形状，形成一个类似试管的物体，圆顶随后被钻一个小孔，其中一个电极通过这个孔插入，并由玻璃吹制工借助煤气喷灯和吹管密封。吹气是通过弧光灯管的另一端完成的，当然那端是开着的。接着在第一个密封处旁边再吹一个小孔，辅助启动电极被密封进去。之后又钻了一个孔，接上一段排气管。",
						"然后将注意力转向弧光灯管另一端的开口，这端也需要像第一端一样封成圆顶。通过将吹管转移到排气管上，可以在弧光灯管第二端的加热圆顶上吹出一个孔。然后密封进第二个主电极，这样弧光灯管的物理构造就完成了。由于所有工序都是手工完成，制作早期灯具需要付出相当多的努力，这也反映在其高昂的售价上。",
						"BTH 开创了一种方法，通过一项非常巧妙的创新，大大提高了制造 MA 弧光灯管的速度。该公司没有用直玻璃管来制作弧光灯管，而是通过在自动 Westlake 机器上将玻璃吹入特制形状的模具中，预先将弧光灯管吹制成接近最终形状。通过改进的 BTH 工艺制成的弧光灯管很容易辨别，因为弧光灯管的周长上会出现微弱的圆形线条，这些印记是玻璃在灯泡吹制机的模具内旋转时留在玻璃上的。对于早期用拉制管制成的弧光灯管，如果玻璃表面有线条，它们会与管轴平行，这些线条是管子拉制过程中形成的。",
						"唯一需要手工劳动的任务是在弧光灯管灯泡的圆顶端钻三个小孔，主电极、辅助电极和排气管分别在每个孔吹好后依次接上。接下来，在弧光灯管的另一端的收缩处密封上最后一个电极，由于这里的圆顶端形状几乎完全成型，所以这是一个快速且简单的过程。随后在自动旋转排气机上进行最终的弧光灯管处理，该机器对弧光灯管进行抽气、烘烤、点亮和充气。然而，手工操作在封顶过程（即将排气管用手工喷灯熔化，以将弧光灯管从抽气机上取下）中得以保留，封顶的精确形状对于灯具的良好性能相当重要。吹制灯泡的弧光灯管的主要生产阶段如下图所示。",
						"用这种机器吹制的灯泡制成的灯具比早期型号要优越得多。在这项发展之前，铝硅酸盐管子一直是手工拉制的，尽管一对熟练的玻璃吹制工可以将管子的直径控制在所需尺寸的毫米之内，但管子往往不是完全圆形的，或者沿其长度的壁厚可能有轻微的锥度。这影响了成品灯具中的温度分布，进而影响了汞蒸气压力，结果是不同灯具之间的光通量差异往往相当大。机器吹制灯泡的一致性大大减少了这种灯具性能的变化。因此，BTH 能够略微提高平均效率，因为几乎可以肯定，新灯具中很少会有超载的情况，而手工拉制管子时由于不确定性可能会出现这种情况。",
						"是普雷斯顿的西门子兄弟公司完成了机械化生产 MA 弧光灯管的任务，通过上述 BTH 工艺的一种变体。他们的方法后来被奥司朗 - GEC 和克伦普顿模仿，美国的西屋公司也采用了这种方法。吹制灯泡弧光灯管的形状被修改为在其顶部有一个小凹陷。在灯具车间，凹陷的尖端被切掉，底部的小块同样被切掉，留下一个两端开口且直径减小的弧光灯管。",
						"接下来，弧光灯管的一端被套在电极组件上，放入一台特殊的压封机中。对弧光灯管的收缩端施加热量，当玻璃达到软化温度时，一对锤子轻轻将其在引线周围压平，从而形成了一个整齐、质量良好的密封。在弧光灯管的另一端重复同样的操作，通过这种方法，MA 灯具的生产大大降低了技术要求。电极定位的一致性得到了改善，灯具性能也随之提高。由于发现将排气管包含在压封中太困难，所以它被接到弧光灯管侧面，同样借助机械夹具来钻孔，然后将排气管熔合在上面。",
						"对于长度异常或直径特殊的灯具，采用了不同的制造技术，因为为半成型灯泡自动吹制模具并不经济。这种生产方法也是 1000W 和 2500W 灯具的标准做法，这些灯具不需要大量生产。弧光灯管是用拉制管制成的，首先在玻璃吹制车床上加热其中心部分，同时使其旋转。加热的中心部分会向内收缩，管子在这一点被分成两半，每一半都留下一个整齐的圆顶端。",
						"然后将一个主电极密封到管子的一半中，另一个电极、辅助电极和排气管被接到管子的另一半上。然后将两半重新组合在一起，并在其相对端密封在一起，形成完整的弧光灯管，如下面的图 35 所示。",
						"为了在玻璃和金属之间形成良好的密封，必须满足两个条件。首先，软化的玻璃必须“润湿”金属并与之粘附，其次，由于各部件的膨胀和收缩速率不同而产生的应力不得超过玻璃的强度，以免密封处开裂或泄漏。钼和钨的热膨胀系数与铝硅酸盐相近，钼的膨胀系数高于这两种金属。尽管在热膨胀系数方面，钨是更好的匹配，但在实际灯具中，钼一直是首选。这是因为当灯具打开时，玻璃和金属的加热速度并不相同 - 电极产生热量，它与引线焊接在一起，因此它比周围的玻璃升温更快。人们发现，由于这种状况，钼密封在升温过程中不太可能开裂。除了最初的 MA 灯具外，所有使用的玻璃的膨胀系数通常约为 43x10⁻⁷ m/°C。",
						"在大多数 MA 灯具中，密封件由直径为 1.0 毫米（0.040 英寸）的磨砂钼丝组成。这种丝是经过特殊处理的，以确保它没有可能导致空气渗入成品灯具的裂缝，并且通常通过电抛光方法和在氢气中或真空中炉内加热进行彻底清洁，以去除可能在密封过程中在玻璃密封中形成气泡的夹杂气体，否则可能会导致开裂。然而，玻璃不会润湿纯钼并粘附在其上，密封实际上是与一层薄薄的氧化层形成的，该氧化层的厚度经过精确控制，通过首先在小煤气火焰中将金属加热到樱桃红热来形成。然后用一个小玻璃套管将丝包覆，该套管与弧光灯管玻璃的成分相同，氧化层溶解在玻璃套管中，形成良好的粘结。如果密封正确形成，丝会呈现出金属棕色或有时深金色。有必要以这种方式预先包覆丝，它们不能直接密封到弧光灯管中。将它们密封进去的热量水平如此之高，以至于会发生进一步的氧化，并且会形成过度氧化的密封，这在使用中很可能会泄漏。",
						"所形成玻璃珠的形状至关重要，因为它决定了在灯具使用寿命期间开裂的可能性。一些轻微的开裂往往是不可避免的，必须控制玻璃珠的形状和内部应力的分布，以便如果形成开裂，它不会穿透灯具壁并导致空气泄漏（Scott，1945）。在最终灯具组装中，包覆的引线随后直接密封到在弧光灯管端部形成的小孔中。这种类型的密封成功地制造了直径达 2.0 毫米（0.080 英寸）的丝，用于制造 2500 瓦特的实验性 MA 灯具。",
						"MA 弧光灯管的排气过程对于上述所有不同的弧光灯管结构方法来说本质上是相同的。为了去除所有外来杂质，有必要在高真空下将弧光灯管加热到远高于其工作温度的温度，典型的排气温度约为 700°C。在早期，弧光灯管是用手工喷灯的简单煤气火焰加热的，其火焰谨慎地覆盖整个弧光灯管。随着生产量的增加，发明了旋转自动抽气机，非常类似于为处理荧光管而开发的设备。弧光灯管在这些设备上要经过几个阶段。首先，它们被抽到粗真空，随着灯泡被加热到尽可能高的温度而不会在真空中吸进去，真空质量逐渐提高。然后它们被充入氩气，并在灯具中建立高电压、高电流交流放电，使电极明亮地发红，从而激活发射颗粒并驱逐杂质。经过烘烤、抽气和轰击过程后，弧光灯管被充入最后剂量的光谱纯氩气。",
						"在整个过程中，必须将少量的汞保留在烤箱外，并保留在排气管侧面的 T 形附件中 - 如果加热，它会汽化并被抽走。当弧光灯管手工从排气机上取下时，它们在侧面 T 形件的上方被长封顶。一旦从泵上取下，灯具可以倾斜，让汞剂量流入弧光灯管。然后将长封顶和侧面 T 形件切掉，汞留在弧光灯管内，最终封顶的形状由熟练的操作员借助煤气喷灯形成。"

						"1936年，飞利浦宣布成功开发出第一种MB汞灯。它被称为Philora HP300，如右图所示，这是通过上一页描述的石英与金属密封技术的发展而实现的。与仅使用一块中间玻璃连接钨和石英不同，这里采用了多块玻璃，从高膨胀系数到低膨胀系数依次堆叠，这使得密封能够在更高的温度下工作，且无需汞块来保护它。移除多余的汞还使灯能够恢复到GEC发明的MA灯的不饱和蒸汽设计，其中全部的汞剂量被蒸发，稳定的放电得以再次实现。由于采用了能够承受更高工作温度的石英灯泡，可以采用相对较短的电弧，而伴随的高功率密度使得该灯具有较高的发光效率。\n\t第一款灯的功率为75W，发光效率达到了令人惊叹的40 lm/W，与400W的MA灯相同。其光通量为300 dekalumens，汞气压为20个大气压，电弧长度为18mm，管径为4mm。它的电弧电压相对较高，为230V（灯电流0.4A），因此这些灯需要从开路电压为410V的变压器供电。整个系统的发光效率为33 lm/W。",
						"尽管GEC早在三年前就为其MA灯引入了内部辅助启动电极，但上述第一款MB灯并未包含这种电极。为了让石英仅容纳一根钨丝作为主电极，已经将其推向了极限，而要并排密封两根电线是绝对不可能的。因此，在弧管的一端缠绕了几圈镍丝，并将其连接到另一端的电极上。设计一款具有如此高电压的灯的部分原因是，变压器的410V开路电压被用来使这个外部电极工作，从而可靠地启动放电。对于设计为在普通市电电压和频率下工作的灯来说，外部辅助电极技术并不总是可靠的。（一个有趣的例外是英国煤矿中使用的40W MBM汞灯，这是第一款由高频电源驱动的放电灯，如图所示）。",
						"飞利浦不仅成功地为世界带来了一种低功率且高效的汞蒸气灯，而且发现这种灯的显色性能比MA灯所能达到的要好得多。这是因为MB型灯的工作压力要高得多，而随着汞气压的增加，显色性能总是会提高。在这种20个大气压的灯的光谱中发现了一小部分连续辐射，其红色比例从MA灯的1%增加到了约2.5%，且没有损失发光效率。MB灯的光谱功率分布如图38所示。"

						"当第一款Philora HP300灯开始大量销售时，其设计中的两个主要特点被发现存在不利之处，需要进行修改。首先，高电弧电压需要使用特殊的变压器镇流器，这种镇流器体积大、价格昂贵且效率低下，严重阻碍了该灯的市场推广。其次，弧管太小，容易快速变黑，导致灯的使用寿命较短。因此，迫切需要开发一款能够解决这两个问题的新灯。\n\t\t正如所有重要的灯具制造商在GEC发明MA灯后的几年内都开始生产MA灯一样，飞利浦发明石英MB灯后也是如此。飞利浦、英国西门子和英国通用电气公司（British Thomson-Houston）这三家公司特别致力于解决这些问题。\n\t\t为了解决变黑问题，决定增加弧管的直径并使其变长，从而增加其内部表面积。为了满足在220-240V开路电压下工作的灯的要求，电弧电压必然需要降至约120V。随着弧管尺寸的增加，这一变化自然发生。",
						"接下来出现了如何在如此低的开路电压下启动放电的问题。实际的解决方案是重新采用位于弧管内的第三个辅助电极。通过巧妙的设计，可以在弧管的侧面增加另一个分级密封的第三根钨丝，而不是像以往的标准做法那样将所有密封导线都穿过弧管的两端。这种密封方式如图39所示，点击此处可以查看采用这种密封方式的灯的示例。",
						"在20世纪30年代初，匈牙利著名发明家、诺贝尔奖得主丹尼斯·加博博士（Dr. Dennis Gabor OBE）为灯具行业做出了巨大贡献，他或许因作为全息术之父而最为人所知，1971年因此获得了诺贝尔奖。",
						"1931年，他在西门子与哈尔斯克（Siemens & Halske）的柏林实验室工作（该公司是当今德国欧司朗公司的前身，与英国的欧司朗-通用电气公司（Osram-GEC）没有任何联系）。在那里，他负责开发一种高压镉灯，这种灯被认为可能是汞灯的可行替代品。他意识到，由于镉对其他玻璃具有相当的腐蚀性，因此必须使用石英作为弧管材料，并且他将大部分精力投入到将金属导体密封在石英中的研究上。1931年，他获得了一项德国专利，该专利基于非常薄、扁平的钼导体。这些钼条如此之薄，尽管其膨胀系数比石英高出约8倍，但箔片足够薄，其膨胀量不足以破坏密封。欧司朗公司在制造用于实验室和医疗应用的紫外线灯时采用了这些密封技术，多年来其他灯具公司仍在努力解决类似问题，却对这种密封技术一无所知。当时，德国欧司朗公司在照明应用中的汞放电方面活动较少，令人惊讶的是，他们没有意识到加博密封的重要性。",
						"随着希特勒在1933年的崛起，加博离开了德国，并在英国拉格比的英国通用电气公司（British Thomson-Houston）的研究实验室获得了发明家的工作。他成为放电灯开发团队的重要资产，在那里他向公司介绍了他的钼箔密封技术，并继续为BTH开发了许多其他想法——其中最著名的是无镇流器放电灯。在飞利浦将其第一款HP300灯投放市场后不久，BTH展示了一款非常相似的产品，但采用了加博的钼箔密封技术。通过电抛光方法将箔片的边缘磨成刀刃，使密封的可靠性得到提高，这使得其边缘呈现出几乎参差不齐的外观。这消除了如果箔片的边缘完全笔直或没有羽毛状，否则会发生的密封泄漏，因为这些边缘往往会形成一条微小的空气通道。采用钼箔密封后，很容易容纳第三根用于辅助启动电极的导线，加博的弧管首次通过BTH Mazda推向市场，为所有石英弧管设定了标准，直到20世纪50年代初。采用钼箔密封的弧管如图41所示。",
						"英国西门子对这种密封技术进行了小幅改进，他们认识到灯具制造过程中的一个严重瓶颈是处理这些薄箔以及将电极焊接在一边，将钼引线焊接在另一边。在早期，焊接过程可以说是完全失控的；将钨焊接到钼上是一项相当高超的技术！西门子采用的技术是取一根钼丝，在中间将其压平。然后将该压平区域轧制成非常细的条带，并像往常一样将其边缘磨尖。这样形成的部件是一个整体，由箔片和两侧的导线组成，可以连接电极并进行外部连接。西门子密封如图42所示。然而，它的存在时间很短，因为不久后，通过使用中间所谓的“仲裁”金属来帮助部件更牢固地粘合在一起，以及通过改进焊接电流的控制，焊接问题得到了克服。各种方法被采用，而且至今仍在使用。通常会在要焊接的一侧对箔片进行铂化处理，或者在焊接前在上面涂上少量铂釉，或者作为替代方案，在要焊接的部件之间夹上一层薄的钽丝或条。焊接电极的电流波形对于制造高质量接头也非常重要。",
						"最近对形成汞弧管的方法的更新是通过一个非常简单的工艺创新，将电极密封到弧管中的过程机械化。不再使用大气压力使石英在箔片周围塌陷，而是开发了一种技术，允许灯具制造商在全自动机器上将石英在箔片周围捏扁。通过在加热过程中持续向要密封的管内通入氩气，防止钼和电极的氧化。\n\t\t为了确保在弧管末端围绕电极形成正确的形状，首先在每个末端减小管径。这通常采用以下三种方法之一。第一种方法是在加热管的同时手动拉伸末端区域，使其直径变小，这种方法需要熟练的玻璃吹制工，而且相当耗时（图43a）。另一种方法是在弧管的每个末端连接一段窄内径的管子（图43b）。或者，只需在电极周围的区域将管子磨薄，形成此处的正确形状，而在此点以下，管子保持其完整直径（图43c）。\n\t\t然后，将电极安装组件放置在垂直安装的弧管内，通过排气管将氩气通入组件，并在大约十秒钟内迅速将管端加热至软化温度。通常使用振荡火焰将热量均匀地分布在要捏合的整个区域表面。然后，在瞬间停止加热，一对黄铜锤从两侧飞来，将石英在箔片周围捏扁。然后在弧管的另一端重复该过程。",
						"在进行捏合密封之前对弧管末端进行预成型的过程相当繁琐，灯具制造商渴望摒弃这一过程，以进一步加快生产速度。1960年，通过在用于制作石英捏合密封的锤子顶部加入一个V形区域，成功地废除了这一过程。通过加热管端更长的石英，作为捏合动作的一部分，可以将其部分向内推入，从而在电极周围形成一个非常整齐的圆锥形端室。这是MB式弧管制造过程中的最后一次工艺改进，从那时起，生产方法基本保持不变。不过，为了加快进程，引入了替代的加热方法。尽管氢氧火焰加热石英的速度相对较慢，但最近的方法涉及将通电极的氩气电离，形成等离子体火炬，类似于原子吸收光谱仪中的火焰。这种方法比传统火焰更快、更经济，但需要大量的资金来构建机器。"
