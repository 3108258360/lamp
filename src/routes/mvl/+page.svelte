					description: [
						"The Mercury lamp was the first kind of metal vapour light source that was mass produced for general lighting applications, and still today it remains one of the most popular discharge lamps produced globally. In Europe it has fallen out of fashion due to its relative inefficiency and rapid lumen depreciation by contrast with other light sources. However in the Americas and Asian countries its low system cost, long life and high colour temperature continue to make it a desirable light source for exterior illumination. Figure 1 illustrates the construction of a typical modern High Pressure Mercury lamp.",
						"At the heart of the lamp is an arc tube which is fabricated from quartz, with a tungsten electrode disposed at either end. The tube contains a few milligrams of mercury and around 25-50 torr of pure argon as a buffer gas to carry the discharge while the lamp warms up, producing heat to vaporise the mercury and bring it into the discharge.",
						"An auxiliary starting electrode is placed next to one of the main electrodes to facilitate lamp ignition. When the lamp is first energised the full open circuit voltage is applied across the arc tube. The distance between the electrodes is so large that the resulting voltage gradient is not high enough to cause ionisation of the gas filling. However the same voltage is also applied between one electrode and the auxiliary via a small resistor. The gap between these electrodes is much smaller, and the voltage gradient is sufficiently high that ionisation will occur. A small discharge strikes, the series resistor of 10-30kW limiting the current flow to about one thousandth of the normal lamp current. Once free electrons, ions and photons have been produced in the arc tube it is then very easy to strike a discharge across the main electrodes. The discharge quickly makes this transition because it can then bypass the starting resistor, and there is no electrical resistance between the main electrodes. Some lamps, particularly high wattage types often include two auxiliary electrodes, one beside each main electrode and connected via a resistor to  the opposite end of the arc tube. This is also standard practice in mercury lamps designed for use in colder atmospheres.",
						"Once the lamp has warmed up and the mercury is fully vaporised, the discharge operates in unsaturated mercury vapour at a pressure varying from 18 bar for the smallest types, to 2 bar for the largest. The arc emits the characteristic green, yellow and violet mercury lines and there there are also considerable amounts of invisible long-wave ultra violet  at 365nm along with a broad range of shorter wavelengths. In the earliest lamps having clear outer bulbs this invisible UV radiation was completely wasted. Today the outer bulb is internally coated with a thin layer of a fluorescent phosphor which converts the UV into visible light, generally at the red end of the spectrum where the mercury output is lacking, to improve the colour rendering properties of this light source.",
						"The outer envelope is filled with a nitrogen or argon-nitrogen mixture, or occasionally with carbon dioxide, both to prevent oxidation of the arc tube seals and to slow the rate of deterioration of certain phosphors. For low power lamps of 50 Watts and below, a vacuum or argon-rich atmosphere is employed by some manufacturers as it affords better thermal insulation, minimising conducted and convected heat losses which can become significant for such small arc tubes, and allowing them to run up to full intensity more quickly. Vacuum or at least reduced gas pressures are also employed in a special range of lamps designed for use in extremely cold atmospheres - again the object here is to provide better thermal insulation which allows the arc tube to warm up more rapidly. Heat-reflective coatings of platinum or gold are often also applied behind the electrodes of small or cold atmosphere lamps again to minimise heat losses and help them run up more rapidly.",
						"By comparison with other common discharge lamps, mercury vapour sources have the lowest luminous efficacy. But during their 100-years of development, numerous changes in materials have taken place to ensure that a gain in performance has occurred every few years right up to the 1980's, when all further development for general lighting lamps effectively ceased. In 2003 however, a significant performance increase was made with the introduction of Philips' new HPL-4 lamp in Europe.",
						"The technological progress in terms of luminous efficacy is compared with other light sources in Figure 2 below. Lumens per watt are only one aspect of lamp performance though, and mercury lamps do have other advantages to offer - principally their colour rendering properties are considerably better than most sodium products, and an extremely low system cost arising from the simple lamp design and basic control gear requirements secures them a market even in some of today's new installations."

						"The luminous efficacy of the mercury discharge is directly related to the vapour pressure at which it operates, and Figure 3 below details the precise relationship for one particular design of lamp. The first  lamps operated at a relatively low pressure of less than one torr and had an efficacy of 17.9 lm/W, just to the right of point B on the graph below, so it is obvious that there was considerable room for improvements in efficacy.",
						"The data here relates to a tube of 27mm diameter with the discharge current being held constant at 4 Amperes (Krefft &amp; Summerer, 1934). For each lamp the precise values will be slightly different, but the general principles are illustrated here.",
						"At the lowest pressure indicated on the graph above (point A), the majority of the mercury radiation is in the ultra-violet part of the spectrum. The temperature of the discharge is low and not a great deal higher than the tube wall, thus with such a small temperature gradient the loss of energy by thermal conduction is minimal and this ultra-violet generation is very efficient. However, the lack of radiation in the visible part of the spectrum means that lamps operating in this pressure region attain an efficacy of only some 10 lm/W.",
						"As pressure increases, so does the luminous efficacy and it reaches a maximum at 0.1 torr (point B) where approximately 20 lm/W can be attained. The reason for the increase is that self-absorption of the mercury resonance lines in the ultra-violet part of the spectrum begins to become significant, with the effect that the relative intensity of other lines in the visible part of the spectrum increases, hence luminous efficacy  rises.",
						"Although such an inefficient discharge might at first seem to be particularly useless for lighting applications (even incandescent lamps can do better!), it should be remembered that fluorescent phosphors can be used to convert invisible ultra violet radiation into useful light. This is the principle of operation in the fluorescent tube in which a discharge  generating the maximum amount of ultra-violet is highly desirable, so the typical mercury vapour pressure is around 0.005 torr. At such a pressure, the efficacy of generating the 253.7nm ultra-violet resonance line is at its maximum. However in this text, only the higher pressure mercury discharges are of interest and detailed information on the fluorescent lamp will be found under that category.",
						"Above 0.1 torr the luminous efficacy (and UV generation) begins to fall again. The reason here is that with increasing pressure, there are more mercury atoms in the tube and the probability of energy being lost due to elastic collisions between a speeding electron and a mercury atom increases. See Figure 4. With more mercury atoms in the discharge tube the electrons must follow a more tortuous path from one electrode to the other, with energy being lost at each collision. Only some of these collisions are sufficiently powerful to lead to ionisation and light generation, many just result in heat losses. As pressure rises, so does this energy loss mechanism hence luminous efficacy begins to suffer. The result of more frequent collisions is that the gas temperature rises to approximately 500Â°C by point C. With such a hot discharge core a considerable amount of the energy input is transferred as heat by thermal conduction to the tube wall, representing a loss of energy so efficacy falls.",
						"Interestingly, a minimum is reached at point C when the pressure is about 5 torr (but depending on the tube diameter) where a fascinating phenomenon begins to occur. Above this pressure the discharge, which completely fills the entire tube diameter at lower pressures, gradually begins to contract inwards towards the axis of the tube until eventually an annular dark region exists between the discharge and the tube wall (see Figure 5). The pressure at which the discharge detatches itself from the tube wall is generally considered to be the point which differentiates the so-called low pressure lamps from all other medium or high pressure lamps.",
						"As pressure increases the discharge becomes more and more constricted, hence the dark space surrounding it also grows. This dark region affords some thermal insulation between the discharge and the tube wall, and it very conveniently reduces the significance of the conducted heat losses. Because the discharge is better insulated its temperature can rise and it soon escalates to approximately 6000Â°C, at which most modern mercury lamps operate. The relative intensity of the mercury lines begins to increase as the discharge contracts but without significant heat losses, the effect being that once again, luminous efficacy rises with increasing pressure.",
						"In addition by this point, the temperature at the core of the discharge has reached a level where temperature radiation begins to set in, and a small amount of continuum appears in the mercury spectrum - literally, this radiation is generated by the incandescence of heated mercury vapour. The increase in luminous efficacy beyond what was previously thought to be a minimum at C was first observed by KÃ¼ch and Retschinsky in 1906.",
						"As pressure continues to rise, the extra radiation is mainly the result of the high temperature of the discharge - consequently a greater amount of continuum radiation is seen. The luminous efficacy at first rises very rapidly beyond point D, but asymptotically reaches a high value as pressures of 100,000 torr or so are reached (approximately 130 atm.) and the luminous efficacy may be as great as 70 lm/W.",
						"High pressure mercury lamps for general lighting applications operate in the pressure range above point D, typically around 4,000 to 8,000 torr (5-10 atmospheres pressure). This is the maximum attainable for a low cost general lighting lamp and is not all that far away from the maximum point shown on the graph. While the luminous efficacy at higher pressures might seem attractive, very large amounts of energy are dissipated in these lamps which require expensive constructions and forced cooling, which make them impractical for all but the most specialised applications.",
						"The spectral power distribution of the mercury discharge depends to a very great extent on the pressure at which it is operating. At low pressures the output is predominantly in the ultra-violet, but as pressure increases self-absorption here results in the visible green, yellow and violet lines becoming relatively stronger.",
						"Above about one atmosphere pressure, a very small amount of continuum radiation begins to enter the spectrum and this progressively increases in strength as pressure continues to rise. It is only just visible in the 10 atmosphere graph below as a continuous spectrum of very low intensity. The addition of wavelengths other than the principal mercury lines by this method can significantly improve the colour rendering properties of the mercury discharge.",
						"At still higher pressures in the tens of atmospheres, line broadening occurs which further enhances colour rendering quality, but the strong peaks still give an overall greenish-blue cast to the mercury spectrum. Continuum radiation can be seen to have significantly increased by this stage. However once pressure enters the region of several hundred atmospheres, the peaks begin to decrease in intensity and the light output gradually attains a more useful colour closer to white.",
						"The spectral power distribution charts in Figure 6 illustrate the changes occurring in the visible part of the mercury spectrum at various pressures. To put the significance of the ultra-violet radiation at low pressures into perspective though, the first chart is on a different scale to include the shorter wavelengths."

						"During the 1930's most of the world's countries introduced their own comprehensive systems of nomenclature to identify the many different kinds of mercury lamps which had become available. Generally these are based on logical code letter systems but in North America, lamps are assigned completely random letters to identify each type. Some of the more commonly encountered systems are disclosed in the tables below. In all cases, more than one letter may be selected from the Third Part to denote special features of the lamp."

					subhead: "Phosphors for Mercury Lamps",
					description: [
						"Since the very beginnings of mercury lighting it had been realised that a significant portion of the energy radiated by all mercury discharges is in the ultra-violet part of the spectrum.&nbsp; In the case of the low pressure discharge, more than half of the total energy supplied is radiated in the short-wave UV region at 253.7nm.&nbsp; High pressure lamps radiate about 10% of their energy in the long-wave UV region at 365.0nm, but an appreciable amount is also radiated at shorter wavelengths.&nbsp; In general lighting applications this UV is wasted since it is invisible to human eyes.&nbsp; But it was known from the outset that certain materials called phosphors exist, which are capable of fluorescing under ultra-violet radiation and generating light of other colours.&nbsp;",
						"In the mid 1930's such materials were put to use in the development of the fluorescent tube, based on converting the plentiful shortwave UV radiation from a low pressure mercury discharge into visible light.&nbsp; The phosphor coating was applied to the inside of the glass tube in which the mercury discharge took place.",
						"However the phosphors developed for the fluorescent tube are not suitable for use with higher pressure mercury lamps.&nbsp; Firstly, they are tailored to respond to shortwave UV, whereas the high pressure discharge radiates a mixture of both short and longwave UV.&nbsp; But of more importance, high pressure mercury lamps run hotter than their low pressure counterparts - the bulb wall temperature is typically of the order of 150 to 250Â°C.&nbsp; Rather inconveniently, the phosphors known at the time had the awkward habit of greatly losing their efficiency at such high operating temperatures.",
						"Thus it did not take long to draw up a set of requirements for new phosphors to be developed for the high pressure mercury lamp, viz: High efficiency at the elevated bulb wall temperature. Chemical stability at the high temperature and under intense UV radiation. Sensitivity to both short and long wave UV from the arc tube. Light absorption to be as little as possible. Ideally, the phosphor should emit red light for colour-correction. Overall light generation should be white, not too far from the blackbody locus",
						"In the early days, some phosphors were discovered which could match one or two of the above criteria, but not all of them!&nbsp; Thus mercury fluorescent lamps could be had in two main types - colour-corrected types where the phosphor contributed a small amount of red light to the spectrum, or high efficacy types where the phosphor contributed a much larger quantity of blue or green light.&nbsp; It was not until the late 1960's that the problem was satisfactorily solved and a new phosphor satisfying all of the above requirements was developed.&nbsp; The following pages in this section chart the development of the five principal families of phosphors which have been employed in mercury lamps.",
						"Before considering each phosphor in detail, it will be helpful to introduce some of the basic principles governing their properties and performance.&nbsp; One of the most fundamental laws which applies to nearly all luminescent solids, is that the wavelength of the emitted radiation is always longer than that of the absorbed radiation.&nbsp; For instance, short-wave UV can be converted into light of any colour, since the wavelength of each colour of light is much longer than UV.&nbsp; Short-wave blue light can similarly be down-converted into longer wavelength red light.&nbsp; But long-wave red light cannot be converted back up to short-wave blue light (except under exceptional circumstances).&nbsp; This general principle which virtually all phosphors follow is called Stokes' Law.",
						"Incidentally when the names of the various phosphors are introduced throughout this section, it will be noticed that they nearly always consist of the host material plus a so-called activator.&nbsp; The activator is generally a minute trace of impurity and curiously, it is generally the activator which determines the wavelength of light emission from each phosphor.&nbsp; When the names are the phosphors are written it is standard practice to write the chemical symbol of the activator after the formula of the host material.&nbsp; For instance, zinc sulphide activated with manganese is written as ZnS : Mn."

						"The first application of a phosphor coating to the outer bulb of a mercury lamp was performed in England, and was the development of the  GEC Hirst Research Centre in Wembley.&nbsp; This was most appropriate in view of the fact that the same laboratory created both the earliest fluorescent tubes and the first practical high pressure mercury lamp just a few years earlier.&nbsp;  The goal of the development was to find a phosphor which could generate some reddish colour light to complement the predominately blue-green light of the mercury discharge, thereby increasing its colour rendering properties.",
						"The year was 1937, and the first lamp to receive the new phosphor treatment was the biggest seller of the day - the 400W MA medium-pressure source with a hard glass arc tube.&nbsp; The luminescent material was zinc cadmium sulphide with a copper impurity as the activator, (Zn,Cd)S: Cu. This type of coating is sensitive to the longwave UV which escapes from MA arc tubes in copious quantities. It efficiently down-converts this UV to an orange-red colour, the precise wavelength depending on both the Zn to Cd ratio and the physical temperature of the bulb wall onto which the fluorescent layer is applied.&nbsp; The development resulted in the so-called MAF lamp, the additional letter F signifying the use of a fluorescent bulb.&nbsp; A typical Osram 400W MAF lamp is shown alongside the clear MA lamp to the right.",
						"It will at once be noticed that the shape of this lamp is very different than the conventional slim tubular outer bulb of normal MA lamps.&nbsp; It was necessary to increase bulb diameter from 51mm to 165mm simply to ensure that the phosphor was sufficiently far removed from the arc tube that its temperature was low enough to allow it to function correctly.&nbsp;",
						"The first lamps had a cylindrical shape, but it was very quickly modified to the  conical isothermal form which is illustrated both above and to the left.&nbsp; The shape of the isothermal bulb matches the temperature distribution of the 400W MA arc tube when run in the cap up position, and the efficacy of the lamp was raised slightly by this approach which ensured that the phosphor temperature was as uniform as possible over the greater part of the bulb surface area.&nbsp; In practice its temperature was maintained fairly accurately in the region of 100-150Â°C by this method, the precise thermal distribution being revealed in Figure XX.",
						"It is interesting to note that despite the extra orange emission of the phosphor, the total luminous flux of the new fluorescent lamps was no greater than for clear types.&nbsp; Firstly the phosphors radiated at the red end of the spectrum, where the sensitivity of the human eye is so low as to deprive the additional light of any significant importance in its contribution to luminous flux.&nbsp; But secondly, the coating also absorbed about as much visible light from the arc tube as it generated from UV down-conversion, effectively nullifying the gain.&nbsp; It's quantum efficiency was fairly low by present day standards, achieving 50% efficiency in converting the 365nm longwave mercury line into visible light, but only 25% efficiency at the shorter 253.7nm wavelength.",
						"The new coating was very valuable in that it boosted the red ratio from 1% to around 4%, a particularly important increase - the spectral power distribution of the phosphor used in these first lamps can be seen in Figure XX.&nbsp; However the chosen material had such a high cadmium content that it showed a natural yellowish colouration.&nbsp; Consequently its transmission of visible light was rather low, its yellowish hue indicating that it was a strong absorber of blue light (an extension of its UV absorption band).&nbsp; The effect  was to filter out much of the blue generated by the arc tube, thus increasing the relative intensity of the remaining green  lines.",
						"Although the orange light from the phosphor was of course very useful, the coating filtered out more blue light than the orange it generated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus the net light output was distinctly greenish and most unpleasant to work under, its spectral power distribution being shown in Figure XX.",
						"The problem was partially overcome in a new MACF lamp, which augmented the mercury charge of the arc tube with a small dose of cadmium, often a trace of zinc as well, two metals which radiate very strongly in the blue.&nbsp; The effect of this was to partially shift the colour point back towards white again by reducing the relative strength of the mercury green lines.&nbsp; The approximate spectral power distribution of the MACF lamp may be compared with the ordinary MAF and MA lamps in Figure XX.&nbsp; Cadmium makes a somewhat inefficient arc tube fill material though, and it had a strong negative impact on lamp efficacy which fell by some 12%.&nbsp; Although the fluorescent mercury-cadmium MACF lamps did deliver better colour rendering with a more pleasant overall white appearance, they were somewhat inefficient creations.&nbsp; The first coated lamps also carried a hefty price premium - costing almost twice as much as a clear lamp even in 1947, ten years after their introduction.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there proved to be a niche market for this kind of mercury lamp and they became successful in  areas where the higher purchase and operating cost could be tolerated.&nbsp; Notably, this occurred only in Europe and in particular the UK.&nbsp; Elsewhere the loss in efficacy was felt to be too significant, and the idea of a coated mercury lamp was rejected until very much later.",
						"In Europe however, developments with phosphors continued.&nbsp; The next step came in 1937 and involved the application of similar coatings to the low wattage 80W and 125W high pressure MB type lamps employing quartz arc tubes - the development this time being led by Philips in the Netherlands, with the GEC following in 1939.&nbsp; In view of the fact that the quartz arc tube operates at higher pressure and naturally generates more red light than the glass versions, the degree of required colour correction was not so great and thinner, more efficient coatings could be used.&nbsp; In addition quartz transmits the shortwave UV to which the glass arc tubes are opaque, and the presence of this radiation meant that some phosphors which were developed for the fluorescent tube could be employed, providing they had the required high-temperature stability.",
						"A new phosphor blend was thus developed for the first MBF lamps.&nbsp; It was based on a thinner layer of the same (Zn,Cd)S:Cu as used in MA lamps, augmented by a blue-luminescing component which made up for the yellowish colour of the original phosphor.&nbsp; The new component was also based on zinc sulphide but with an activator of silver instead of copper, ZnS:Ag, this substitution being responsible for the change in colour of fluorescence.&nbsp; The cadmium addition which was required in MA arc tubes could therefore be dispensed with and consequently MBF lamps were able to achieve very nearly the same luminous efficacy as the uncoated MB types.&nbsp; For every lumen which was absorbed by the coating, it re-radiated almost one lumen of orange + blue light, making it an efficient light source with rather good colour rendering  for its time.",
						"Incidentally as was the case for the MAF lamp, the size of the outer bulbs of MBF lamps also had to be increased to keep the phosphor coating cool enough for good performance.&nbsp; The new silver-activated phosphor was especially sensitive to temperature and whereas a maximum of 175Â°C could be tolerated in MAF lamps, 100-125Â°C or so was the practical limit for MBF types.&nbsp; The 80W lamps were therefore increased from 80mm to 110mm in diameter, while the 125W size grew from 90mm to 130mm.&nbsp; Traditionally these lamps had all been fitted with standard 3-pin bayonet or E27s Edison Screw caps, but from the mechanical standpoint, it was not sensible to fit such a small cap onto so large a bulb otherwise many breakages would have occurred.&nbsp; It was therefore decided to offer the inflated 125W size lamps with a large E40s Goliath Edison Screw cap for new installations.",
						"The new MBF lamps were tremendously successful in the UK, in fact so successful that evidence of the 1940's boom in low wattage mercury fluorescent lamps still remains today.&nbsp; Despite mercury lamps having now shrunk down to much more compact dimensions, today's 125W lamps are still offered with the now grossly oversized E40s large screw cap.&nbsp; Remarkably there is still a sufficiently large installed base of old 1940's luminaires to justify making new lamps with this cap type for replacement purposes!&nbsp; It is surprising that the MBF lamps were still not widely accepted outside the UK though, perhaps owing to the colour quality not being marvellous and worth the considerably higher price those lamps demanded.&nbsp; Developments in the earliest MBF lamps therefore took place most actively within the British mercury lamp manufacturers of the time - The British Thomson-Houston Co., Osram-GEC, Metropolitan Vickers, The Edison-Swan Electric Co., Siemens Bros., Philips UK and Messrs. Crompton-Parkinson."

						"The development of the mercury lamp was to take a significant turn in the late 1940's with the development of a sensational new phosphor, based on magnesium germanate activated with manganese (Mg2GeO4:Mn).&nbsp; The key feature of this material was its temperature characteristic, which made it supremely useful as a phosphor to be coated on the outer jackets of high pressure mercury lamps.&nbsp;",
						"It will be remembered that traditionally, phosphors tend to lose their efficiency as they reach higher temperatures.&nbsp; Thus the first mercury fluorescent lamps with sulphide phosphors had to be made with grossly oversized bulbs to keep the phosphor temperature as low as possible.&nbsp; Magnesium germanate, however, exhibits a peak in its efficiency when it is at a temperature of 300Â°C - precisely the kind of temperature at which the outer bulbs of mercury lamps operate.&nbsp; It is also stable over long periods at elevated temperatures so lamps could be made in which the phosphor maintained a high efficacy throughout life.",
						"Since 1936 it had  been known that Mg2GeO4:Mn gave a strong red fluorescence.&nbsp; The phosphor was invented by Humboldt Leverenz at the Radiophone Corporation of America (now GE's NBC Television company) and he intended it to be a more durable coating for the fluorescent screens of his company's cathode ray tubes (Leverenz, 1936).&nbsp; At the time it was a rather inefficient, but very durable generator of red light.&nbsp; Then in 1947 it was discovered that by adding an excess of MgO, phosphors could be made which were five times more efficient (Patten &amp; Williams, 1947).&nbsp; But the real breakthrough came in 1950 when Luke Thorington of Westinghouse made a further improvement which was to make the material suitably efficient as a phosphor for mercury lamps.",
						"He found that if part of the MgO (0.5 moles) in the composition                 4 MgO.GeO2:Mn was substituted with magnesium fluoride, MgF2, then the light output could be doubled yet again (Thorington, 1950).&nbsp; It is believed that the presence of fluorine results in a more thorough reaction of the components from which is phosphor is manufactured, yielding the new material magnesium fluoro-germanate, MgFGeO4:Mn.&nbsp; The combined high efficacy, thermal stability and strong red radiation peaking at  658nm saw MgFGeO4:Mn hold is place as the principal mercury lamp phosphor for nearly two decades.&nbsp; Despite the thermal stability the colour of fluorescence does shift towards orange at higher temperatures, so it is still desirable to keep the bulb wall temperature fairly low, certainly no more than 200-250Â°C.&nbsp; The spectral emission at typical lamp operating temperatures is shown in Figure XX.",
						"The first lamps to make use of the new phosphor were launched of course by Westinghouse, its inventor, around 1950.&nbsp; They offered a sizeable increase in the red ratio of up to 7%, nearly doubling again the red content that had been attained with earlier British developments with the sulphide phosphors.&nbsp; The spectral power distribution of a lamp made with this phosphor is illustrated in Figure XX.&nbsp; Despite the extra red luminescence, the increase in luminous flux is still almost negligible.&nbsp; Although magnesium fluoro-germanate is not nearly so strongly coloured as the earlier sulphides, it does still have a slightly off-white yellowish hint.&nbsp; The coating also has to be applied in a somewhat thicker layer than with earlier sulphides, and consequently once again, the coating absorbs as much light as the extra it generats.",
						"The slight yellowish tinge is a result of the absorption of blue light at around 420nm, once again sapping up some of the  light generated by the mercury arc, although the amount absorbed is considerably less than with earlier materials.&nbsp; Nevertheless, this blue absorption is still sufficient to impart a very slightly greenish hue to the light from  lamps bearing this coating.&nbsp; The blue absorption also increases at higher operating temperatures so despite the high temperature stability of this phosphor, it is still desirable to keep its temperature low.&nbsp; The blue absorption is sufficiently small though that for the vast majority of applications the greenish tint proved to be acceptable, in just the same way as the light from an incandescent lamp appears somewhat yellowish.",
						"This phosphor is prepared essentially from a high temperature reaction between MgO, MgF2 and GeO2 with the addition of a trace amount of the activator, Mn.&nbsp; The performance of the finished material is highly dependent on the precise firing time and temperature, as is the case for most phosphors.&nbsp; The actual time and temperature required are depending on the starting particle sizes of the raw materials, but the best phosphors in general are obtained after firing at a temperature of between 1100Â°C and 1200Â°C for  eight hours.",
						"During the firing process the grains all grow in size as the reaction proceeds.&nbsp; The higher the temperature and longer the firing time, the larger the grains will become and this is good for a high efficiency final phosphor.&nbsp; Incidentally it is also found that firing the phosphor in closed crucibles is greatly beneficial, this leading to a much coarser grain structure.&nbsp; When open crucibles are used the rate of fluorine loss is quite rapid, and since fluorine is the active agent in grain growth it is beneficial to keep its concentration high, and the closed crucibles assist greatly in this matter.",
						"The importance of the coarse large-grained structure is simple to understand.&nbsp; If the grains are large, then a relatively thick coating can be applied but the amount of light absorption within the coating is small - this is because absorption principally occurs as a result of the boundaries between one grain and the next, and if the grains are larger, then there are fewer boundaries hence light absorption will be reduced."

						"Around the same time that Luke Thorington had perfected the magnesium fluoro-germanate phosphor with Westinghouse in the USA, a remarkably similar material was brought to the attention of the Philips Laboratories in Eindhoven by a Mr. Travnicek of Graz, Austria.&nbsp; The material was magnesium arsenate activated by tetravalent manganese, 6MgO.As2O5:Mn4+, and during the previous few years Philips had built up substantial expertise in the preparation of Mn4+phosphors.&nbsp; Previously the company had pinned its hopes on a phosphor based on Magnesium titanate with the same activator, that material having a very desirable red emission but unfortunately its quantum efficiency could not be raised to levels making it suitable for use as a mercury lamp phosphor.",
						"The Eindhoven phosphor team was quickly able to adapt its titanate processes to investigate the arsenate instead, and it was this material which ultimately led to Philips' decision to bring the HPL fluorescent mercury lamp into mass production. (Incidentally in Dutch light source nomenclature, the MB lamps are known as the HP type, while their MBF fluorescent counterparts are classified as the HPL type.&nbsp; H = Hg or Mercury, P = high Pressure, L = Luminescent).",
						"The properties of this magnesium arsenate phosphor turned out to be highly favourable for its application in the company's HPL / MBF products.&nbsp; Its fluorescence is bright red peaking sharply at 656nm (Figure XX), it absorbs the whole UV emission from the mercury arc tube, its quantum efficiency is 75% for both the long and shortwave UV stimulation, and its efficiency is stable right up to 300C (Figure XX).&nbsp; Its first apparent disadvantage is that the very broad absorption of UV radiation extends slightly into the visible spectrum, and consequently some blue light is absorbed and the phopshor has a faint yellowish colouration.&nbsp; Nevertheless this is considerably less than is the case for earlier phosphors and the colour output of arsenate lamps is in no way rendered greenish.",

						"Previously Philips had made HPL lamps in only very small quantities indeed, based on the early developments in sulphide phosphors.&nbsp; But from 1950 onwards the company marketed its mercury fluorescent lamps with coatings of the arsenate phosphor which proved to be a very valuable asset.&nbsp; Other lampmakers around the world had been forced to adopt Westinghouse's magnesium fluoro-germanate material and were tied to that source, while Philips had the freedom to make lamps based on its own developments.&nbsp; The red ratio of Philips' new lamps was 7.5-9%, somewhat higher than the 7% that had been attainable with magnesium fluoro-germanate, and with germanium being a very expensive raw material the price of the Philips phosphor was also some four times cheaper.&nbsp; The thickness of the phosphor coating was chosen so as to deliver the same luminous flux from coated lamps as the clear versions.&nbsp; This could have been made thicker and allowed the phosphor to absorb all of the UV generation of the arc tube and emit more red light, but at these kinds of thicknesses blue absorption became a problem, thus shifting the colour point towards the green.",
						"In the beginning however, it was unfortunately learned that magnesium arsenate suffered a sharp decline in its efficiency during the lifetime of the HPL lamps to which it was applied, and the red ratio fell very rapidly.&nbsp; While other phosphors had to be abandoned because of their lack of durability, some ingenious thinking at Philips enabled the engineers to overcome this problem through a very simple approach.",
						"It was determined that part of the minutely small concentration of Mn4+activator had been reduced to Mn2+, this occurring because of the slightly reducing atmosphere present inside a nitrogen-filled mercury lamp outer bulb.&nbsp; Experiments were therefore conducted with new lamps containing trace amounts of oxygen in the nitrogen filling of the outer bulb, the new oxidising atmosphere theoretically being sufficient to prevent the reduction of Mn4+.&nbsp; Indeed it was subsequently proven that with 0.3% to 0.5% of oxygen in the nitrogen filling, there was no decline in the red radiation of the phosphor throughout lamp life.",
						"However, there is a reason why the outer bulbs of mercury lamps were nitrogen filled in the first place - it is because the smallest traces of oxygen are sufficient to cause oxidation of the molybdenum foil seals which carry the current through the quartz of the arc tube.&nbsp; In the oxygen doped lamps the seals would oxidise, expand, and split open the arc tubes within a matter of only some tens of hours of operation.",
						"This problem can be overcome by reducing the temperature at the outward extremities of the molybdenum foil pinch-seals simply by increasing the length of the seal.&nbsp; In fact good lamps were made this way in which the seal temperature was reduced from 500Â°C into a safe zone below 250Â°C, but such a long seal could not easily be made on automatic production equipment.&nbsp; The long-seal lamps were therefore not a viable solution to the problem.",
						"The reason for having used 0.3-0.5% of oxygen in the lamps was because during life, the various metal parts in the lamp also oxidise and bind this oxygen through getter action, and therefore enough oxygen had to be provided at the outset to last for the entire lamp life.&nbsp; It is unfortunate that the amount required was so high that it caused the seals to oxidise.&nbsp; It was as a result of this recognition that Philips devised an ingenious solution - to fill the bulb with a gas which very slowly broke down under the action of the internal UV radiation, continuously providing just enough oxygen to protect the phosphor but not so much that the seals would oxidise.&nbsp; The gas chosen was carbon dioxide.",
						"It was found that 0.5 torr filling of CO2 provided an adequate source of oxygen to protect the phosphor.&nbsp; Such a pressure is rather low though and causes the arc tubes to run somewhat hotter than usual - previously a nitrogen fill pressure of 500 torr had been used, this offering sufficiently high thermal conductivity and convection losses to maintain the arc tube at its correct temperature.&nbsp; Very fortunately it was found that increasing the CO2 pressure to similar levels had no adverse effect, and the partial pressure levels of oxygen do not rise with increasing CO2 pressure.&nbsp; The reason is because the volume CO + O2 evolved as a result of the dissociation of CO2 is roughly 50% greater than the volume of CO2 itself, hence increasing the CO2 pressure in the bulb actually results in a lower rate of dissociation and reduced oxygen partial pressure.",
						"In later work it was discovered that the reduction of the Mn4+ activator could be inhibited by replacing part of the MgO raw material with Li2O.&nbsp; This increased the UV and high temperature stability of the material and allowed the critically balanced carbon dioxide filling system to be abandoned in favour of the original and cheaper nitrogen.&nbsp; An interesting spinoff was that the incorporation of lithium also slightly changed the heights of the various emission peaks of the material.",
						"It is found that the fluorescent intensity is very strongly depending on MgO/As2O5 ratio, so much so that the composition corresponding to the orthophosphate (3MgO.As2O5:Mn4+)\n                                                                            is practically non-fluorescing.&nbsp; It is a strong UV-absorber but simply does not fluoresce.&nbsp; Increasing the MgO concentration results in an increase in fluorescent intensity up to the point where a maximum is obtained at                 6MgO.As2O5:Mn4+, the composition which was employed in all lamps.",
						"The tolerances to which this phosphor must be made are quite critical.&nbsp; Any under-dosing of MgO results in the formation of the non-fluorescent UV absorbing orthophosphate phase mentioned above, markedly decreasing the fluorescence.&nbsp; Adding an excess of MgO simply results in an excess of that compound in the finished product.&nbsp; It is not a UV absorber and therefore the rate of fall off in fluorescence is not so severe as for under-dosing, but it does still diminish due to extra scattering.",
						"During production, part of the Mg is added in the form of MgF2 which accelerates the rate of the reaction, just as is the case for magnesium fluoro-germanate.&nbsp; With that phosphor it has the effect of doubling the fluorescent intensity, but with magnesium arsenate it only has the effect of increasing the durability of the material to ensure that the phosphor does not lose its fluorescent intensity during lamp life."

						"Unlike other phosphors employed in mercury lamps, the barium-strontium-lithium silicate material developed by Osram-GEC in England fluoresces with a range of colours comprising red, orange and blue along with intermediate shades of these colours.&nbsp; It consists of a mixture of barium lithium silicate and strontium lithium silicate and by varying the proportions of each, a continuous series of solid solutions can be formed with a wide variety of luminescent properties.&nbsp; It functions in much the same way as the halophosphate group of materials which were also invented by the GEC for use in fluorescent tubes.",
						"A double activator is employed in this group.&nbsp; Trivalent cerium is the primary activator and this leads to the blue emission, but also acts to sensitise the secondary activator, manganese.&nbsp; As the manganese content is increased the intensity of the blue emission falls in favour of increased orange-red emission that is characteristic of manganese.&nbsp;",
						"If just the barium lithium silicate component is first considered, the manganese emission is rich orange, but this can be made significantly redder as strontium atoms replace barium.&nbsp; This is an important addition because when raised to the lamp operating temperature the emission shifts towards the yellow, but this can of course be minimised by starting with a higher strontium concentration.",
						"Unlike the germanate and arsenate phosphors already described, the silicate materials are almost completely snowy-white in body colour and consequently their light absorption is low, and lamp efficacy can be quite high.&nbsp; There is a UV absorption peak at 360nm, conveniently very close to the 365nm radiation of the mercury discharge, and this diminishes almost entirely to zero by 420nm, hence the very small blue absorption.&nbsp; The colour temperature of lamps made with the optimum material is typically around 4400K, the chromaticity co-ordinates being x=0.36 and y=0.38.&nbsp; It is not so far shifted towards the green as for germanate and arsenate phosphors but its colour temperature is slightly higher on account of the blue emission of the phosphor.",
						"Sulphide, Germanata and Arsenate phosphors are traditionally applied to the glass bulb as a suspension in a nitrocellulose binder, as used to be standard practice for coating tubular fluorescent lamps.&nbsp; Subsequently the coated bulbs are baked in air at 500Â°C to burn out the binder, but the required bake-out temperature is too high for the silicate phosphors.&nbsp; The cerium activator is oxidised in air at such high temperatures with most undesirable effects on the efficiency of the phosphor.",
						"A technique was therefore developed which allowed the lamp manufacturer to spray or dust the dry powder onto the inner surface of a bulb which had previously been wetted a film of dilute phosphoric acid.&nbsp; Following a reduced temperature bake-out at 300Â°C in an inert atmosphere the coating was then dried out and adhered to the bulb wall without degradation of the cerium activator.",
						"When any phosphor is applied to the bulb it is desirable that the coating should be sufficently thick that it absorbs all of the UV for conversion into visible light.&nbsp; With germanate and arsenate coatings this is not possible, because the blue absorption then becomes so high that relatively more of the mercury green line is transmitted and the lamp imparts an unpleasant greenish hue to all that it illuminates.&nbsp; Coating weight therefore has to be a compromise at about 3mg per cm2 at which there is still some blue absorption.&nbsp; With the silicate phosphors this same coating weight is sufficient to absorb all of the UV and there is no significant blue absorption.&nbsp; This is one of the primary advantages of the silicate phosphor - it may not be quite so efficient, but it allows lamps to be made which have a more natural white light emission.",
						"Just like with Philips' magnesium arsenate lamps, it was found that the red ratio of silicate lamps depreciated rather rapidly, but that once again this could be eliminated with a carbon dioxide gas filling.&nbsp; The reason for this was never determined.&nbsp; In the Philips lamps it works by providing a tiny partial pressure of oxygen which prevents the tetravalent manganese activator being reduced to the divalent species.&nbsp; However since the manganese activator starts out as divalent with the GEC silicate phosphor, the mechanism must be different.&nbsp; Furthermore an oxidising atmosphere is known to be detrimental to the primary activator of cerium and yet this does not appear to be degraded as a result of the CO2 bulb filling."

						"The orthophosphates were the last family of phosphors to be introduced before the present material yttrium vanadate came into service.&nbsp; They are all activated with tin, which must be in the divalent state to give luminescence.",
						"All tin-activated phosphors are characterised by a their very broad spectral energy emission.&nbsp; Typically they cannot achieve such a deep red emission as is possible from previously mentioned materials, but their quantum efficiency is remarkably high, as much as 87% for magnesium orthophosphate.&nbsp; They are colourless so the light transmission is high, and because the emission is at wavelengths to which the human eye is more sensitive, lamps with remarkably high luminous efficacy can be fabricated.&nbsp; They do, however, leave a lot to be desired in terms of their colour rendering properties, but from the early 1960's until the late 1980's many manufacturers offered two different kinds of mercury lamp - types with good colour rendering, and types with high efficacy at the expense of colour properties.",
						"Strontium orthophosphate, (Sr,Mg)3(PO4)2:Sn2+ modified with Mg to adjust the crystal lattice structure was the most commonly employed material in high efficacy lamps.&nbsp; Its emission peak lies at 630nm at room temperature, decreasing to shorter wavelengths quite dramatically at lamp operating temperatures but the light emission remains high.&nbsp; By 330Â°C the red emission peak has shifted to 570nm so it is clearly evident that colour rendering of these lamps suffers.&nbsp; While a magnesium germanate 400W lamp gives a red ratio of about 7.5%, the strontium orthophosphate lamps only manage about 5%.",
						"Similar performance was attained from calcium orthophosphate modified with Mg and this material found preference with some of the eastern European manufacturers.&nbsp; It has slightly higher efficiency again, but red ratio falls further to 4.4%, really no better than the first MAF type lamps.",
						"Meanwhile Sylvania in the USA developed materials based on calcium-zinc orthophosphates, and a particular 400W lamp attained an efficacy of 59.5lm/W.&nbsp; This was excellent by comparison with the 49lm/W attainable from red-emitting phosphors at the time, and is still impressive compared with the 55lm/W of present-day lamps with vanadate based coatings.",
						"When Vanadate coatings became available in the late 1960's though, they entirely superseded the high-efficacy line of mercury lamps in all countries except the USA, where a demand curiously continued for the old-fashioned inefficient coatings for nearly twenty years more.&nbsp; The vanadate phosphors offered 10% higher luminous efficacy and considerably enhanced colour rendering properties as well while also being pure white in colour, for the first time satisfying all of the requirements of a mercury lamp phosphor."

It offered equivalent performance to the oxide phosphor but without the adhesion problems.&nbsp; The technology was quickly transferred from the company's cathode ray tube division to the lamp department, where it was immediately adopted in mercury discharge lamps.",

High quantum efficiency. Sensitivity to both short and long-wave UV stimulation. Colourless, i.e. no longer was blue light absorbed by the coating. Efficient at high lamp operating temperatures. Stable throughout very long lamp lives. Despite the high cost of europium and yttrium the advantages of this phosphor were such that every customer cried out for the new colour-improved lamps, and its cost was easily justified.&nbsp;",
						"The red emission peaks of this phosphor centre at around 615-619nm, much shorter wavelengths than the former deep red 658nm peak of the germanate and arsenate materials.&nbsp; But owing to the spectral sensitivity of the human eye, this is still seen as red, and it is a wavelength to which the eye is much more sensitive.&nbsp; A combination of this effect, and the fact that the new powder coating had a much lower absorption of other wavelengths, the total luminous efficacy of vandate lamps increased by around 10% at the same time.",
						"Subsequently in later years, the problems with yttrium oxides were also overcome, and today it is an important fluorescent lamp phosphor.&nbsp; Despite its slightly lower cost, it has never become popular in mercury lamp use and all manufacturers today still continue with the vanadate material, even though the performance of both phosphors is substantially the same."

						"Although Humphry Davy demonstrated the possibility of producing light from a discharge in mercury vapour as early as 1821 by maintaining an arc between a wire and a pool of mercury, it is to the British inventor Professor J.T. Way that credit must go for the first  demonstration of a practical lamp. On September 3rd 1860 he completed an installation of modified carbon arc lamps on the Hungerford suspension bridge in London, in which the arc operated within a glass vessel containing air and a sizeable pool of mercury. The actual point of light generation in the carbon arc is the incandescence of the electrode tips, the arc itself being substantially non-radiative. But in J.T Way's lamp the heat from the discharge caused a small amount of mercury to evaporate, filling the glass chamber with its vapour, which was consequently ionised and imparted its blue-green colouration to the arc while also greatly increasing the total light output from this source.",
						"He was duly granted a British Patent for this novel extension of carbon arc lighting technology. One point worthy of mention is the method employed for starting the arc in his lamp. With the ordinary carbon arc the discharge was struck by bringing one of the electrode tips into contact with the other, and then withdrawing it slightly, the arc initiating as soon as contact was broken. This inconvenient method was surpassed in the mercury lamp, in which the upper electrode was fabricated with a small hole running along its length. To strike the arc, part of the mercury was poured through this hollow electrode, falling into contact with the lower electrode and automatically initiating the discharge once the flow finished and contact was broken. The electrodes in the lamp were stationary and as they burned away during use, complex electrical control gear would have been necessary to adjust the electrical supply as the arc gap lengthened.",
						'The health and safety issues associated with such a lamp would be horrendous today, since mercury was freely vaporised and released into the open atmosphere. Even their use outdoors would have been hazardous as a cloud of dense mercury vapour escaping from the lamps would have descended on passers by below. No other known installations of  Way\'s lamp are known, and in view of its dramatically enhanced performance this seems unusual. It is probable that even in the mid 19th century there were concerns over the possible poisonous side-effects of the lamp he developed. Certainly at this time it was becoming known that  mercury was a prominent neurotoxin, attacking the brain and spinal cord. Mercury compounds employed in the manufacture of felt, particularly favoured by hat-makers, were known for their undesirable side effects leading to premature dementia - hence the common phrase "mad as a hatter".'

						"The next milestone in mercury lamp development was laid in the summer of 1906, when there appeared in the Annalen der Physik a paper by KÃ¼ch and Retschinsky concerning the production of light by a high pressure mercury discharge.",
						"Their lamp resembled a scaled-down model of the Cooper-Hewitt, but it was fabricated from quartz glass and employed two electrodes of liquid mercury. Ignition was performed by tilting the lamp so that a thread of mercury short-circuited the electrodes, the arc being started by levelling the tube and breaking the contact between the electrodes. The lamps were still DC operated. Quartz, being a much more refractory material than the hard glasses employed by Cooper-Hewitt, could endure much higher electrical loadings under which conditions the lamp efficacy rises. Such conditions naturally led to higher temperatures and higher mercury pressures as well. The inventors managed to attain pressures of several atmospheres, at which a luminous efficacy of about 50 lumens per watt was achieved. Figure 16 shows a photograph of their lamp.",
						"Although these quartz lamps were manufactured by Westinghouse (via the Cooper-Hewitt company) and later by GE, they were not practical as light sources for general lighting. The quartz envelope allowed allowed the lamp to transmit dangerously high levels of ultraviolet radiation, which incidentally developed another niche for their application - as artificial UV lamps for sun-tanning and other therapeutic uses.",
						"Additionally , and there existed no reliable method for sealing metal conductors into quartz. These early lamps employed seals in which precisely shaped conical indentations were ground into the quartz ends of the lamp, and each had to be individually tailored to mate with a tapered invar pin of identical dimensions, the whole being immersed in mercury. If the lamps didn't leak when new, they lasted only a relatively short time in service before failure of the seals brought the lamps to the end of their life.",
						"It was also required, for safety reasons, to prevent the mercury pressure rising too high under which conditions the lamp could explode. Commercially available lamps were therefore equipped with metal fins clamped to the arc tube around the mercury electrodes, serving to reduce the temperature here and keep the pressure within safe limits. They were most commonly employed in scientific or medical applications, for instance as ultra-violet sun lamps used in the treatment of various skin conditions."

						"Around the turn of the century, the first mercury lamp to become a commercial success was created by the American inventor Peter Cooper-Hewitt, Figure 8. By 1901 his development was complete and a year later he founded the Cooper-Hewitt Electric Co. of New York, backed with money from George Westinghouse.\n\t\tHis low-pressure mercury discharge radiated copious amounts of blue and green light but was severely deficient in red, and had the most appalling colour rendering ability. Despite its guaranteed ability to transform even the most beautiful human subject into a ghastly cadaverous specimen, it enjoyed remarkable success in industrial lighting. Lighting economics was the reason, and it had not gone unnoticed that for the same electricity consumption, mercury lamps put out many times more light than the carbon filaments.",
						'In 1902 the inventor stated "When it is considered that this light, when obtained with mercury gas, has an efficiency at least eight times as great as that obtained by an ordinary incandescent lamp, it will be appreciated that it has its use in places where lack of red is not important, for the economy of operation will much more than compensate for the somewhat unnatural colour given to illuminated objects"\n         Improving the colour was tackled through an early use of fluorescent materials, whereby reflectors around the lamp were given a coat of the rosy coloured dye Rhodamine. An alternative invention of Cooper-Hewitt was to employ series-wired carbon filament lamps to act as the ballast for his lamp, and these delivered a strong red contribution but did reduce  efficacy somewhat. The example illustrated in Fig. 9 is the earliest ancestor of modern mercury blended lamps.\n          The light was also prone to flickering as the root of the discharge danced around on its electrode of boiling mercury, and although the inventor fine-tuned his lamp geometry to minimise this, the problem could not be eradicated.',
						"Nevertheless the lamp enjoyed great success in industrial lighting the photo-printing business, which both required large amounts of cheap light and where colour was of little concern. Fig. 10 shows a typical 1908 advertisement aimed at the printing industry.\n        Factory lighting is a market in which it gradually lost popularity though, as a result of the tremendous advances occurring in incandescent technology. Within a decade or two the tungsten lamp had been developed to the state that it began to pose a serious threat to the sole stronghold of mercury - its previously unparalleled efficacy.",
						"The Cooper-Hewitt company embarked on a bold marketing campaign, often with rather extravagant claims that the lack of red radiation was in fact to be regarded as quite an advantage. It was stated that the fatigue of the eyes produced by close work under artificial light was due almost entirely to the presence of 'harmful red rays' in the spectrum of the incandescent lamp. The mercury lamp was subsequently promoted with renewed force in such applications as offices of draughtsmen, or in environments where close attention to books and papers is required\n        Eventually the more efficient tungsten filaments poached its place in industrial illumination, and the Cooper-Hewitt lamp was thereafter exiled to the sizeable graphic arts industry.  Its harsh blue light of high actinic value was a perfect match with the requirements of the slow emulsions used in diazo photo-printing processes of the time.  It continued as a profitable business, and encouraging results with higher pressure discharges in Europe later re-kindled the interest in mercury lamps for general lighting.\n\t\tBy 1919 the business and technology had developed to the extent that it could no longer be ignored by the giant General Electric Company of America, which bought out the Cooper-Hewitt company.  Production relocated from the original factory at 220 West 29th Street in Manhattan, and GE established its own Vapor Lamp Department at the Grand St. premises in Hoboken, New Jersey.  As new lamp types continued to be developed in Europe they were quickly adopted at GE's plant and then copied by other American manufacturers. In 1934 an improved Cooper-Hewitt lamp was developed, and it is remarkable that this continued in production at GE's plant until 1965. In the rest of the world the European style medium pressure and high pressure mercury lamps were adopted immediately, and it was only in North America that the antiquated Cooper-Hewitt lamps continued to live on for many more decades."

						"The first successful lamp consisted of a slender glass tube fabricated of the hardest borosilicate glass, containing a hefty dose of around a pound of mercury which was sealed in under very high vacuum - no gas filling was employed in the Cooper-Hewitt lamps. Initially the lamp was suitable only for operation on direct current, the anode  taking the form of a hollow iron cylinder, and the cathode being a large pool of mercury residing in a bulbous reservoir at the opposite end of the tube. The discharge length was fifty inches (1270 mm), the tube diameter one inch (25 mm), and the first model is illustrated in Figure 11.",
						"With a current of 3.5 Amps the lamp dropped 110 Volts across its length and drew a sizeable power of 385 Watts. The total light output was some 6,900 lumens when new, giving it a very desirable luminous efficacy of 17.9 lm/W. However owing to the great losses in the crude electrical control gear of the last century, the total system efficacy fell to 14.2 lm/W. Such a value was attained by gas-filled tungsten lamps of similar luminous flux in the 1920's, so it is easy to see why the Cooper-Hewitt lamp gradually lost its popularity. Its marginally longer life and superior lumen maintenance (Figure 12) helped it put up a strong fight though, and of course the high actinic value of the light ensured that it held a strong position in the photographic applications.",
						"It is of interest to note that the electrodes in this lamp underwent a continuous recycling process during operation. Of course most heat was developed at the liquid cathode which naturally evaporated. Whereas in any other discharge lamp the evaporated electrode material adheres to the bulb wall, blackening it and absorbing light, the unique liquid electrode in this lamp would continuously flow back to its home again. The  imperfect lumen maintenance record is simply attributable to the wear on the iron anode, which of course was sputtered and wore away just as in any other modern discharge lamp.",
						"The mercury cathode was necessary since the heat generated here was required to vaporise enough of the metal, however it limited the maximum mercury vapour pressure to that attained at its boiling point,  357Â°C. In addition the discharge temperature was low, an estimated 500Â°C at its core and it rapidly diminished to only 125Â°C at the tube wall. Cooper-Hewitt was held back by the low pressure associated with this, and limited by the glass and anode materials of his lamp. Consequently it could never enjoy the improved efficacy and colour properties that are so easily attainable with new materials at our disposal today, although in later years following the work of KÃ¼ch and Retschinsky, a much more efficient quartz Cooper-Hewitt style lamp was made. Westinghouse, the original financial backers of this lamp, undertook the manufacture of quartz products from 1908 onwards and sold them as sun-tan lamps for many years. Similar European products were offered from 1910 under the names of Bastian or Spanner lamps.",
						"A great many other style lamps were also offered. Principally these took the form of the standard 50-inch glass tube being bent into a U or M shape to make it more compact, but also an AC version was developed in later years. This was essentially a modification of the Cooper-Hewitt mercury rectifier tube, consisting of a single mercury cathode but two adjacent iron anodes, the arc alternating between these with the periodicity of the electricity supply. Specialised electrical control gear was necessary to run this lamp and provide means such that the  current waveform lagged the voltage waveform, to ensure that the arc would never completely extinguish during the zero-voltage phase of the AC electricity supply.",
						"A further drawback of all of these lamps was that they contained mercury in great excess and the vapour inside the tube was always saturated. In other words a change in lamp temperature would result in more or less mercury being vaporised into the discharge, with a consequent change in the electrical characteristics of the discharge and the light output. Such variations in ambient temperature or the supply voltage led to undesirable changes in lamp performance over a very wide range."

						"Ignition of the arc was performed crudely but effectively by a most intriguing action which was adopted from the methods used to start a carbon arc. When energised, the full voltage would be applied across the length of the lamp - this being insufficient to prevent electrical breakdown of the internal atmosphere (essentially a hard vacuum plus the vapour pressure of mercury at room temperature). Of course, the required striking voltage can be reduced by decreasing the gap between the electrodes, and when one is fortunate enough to have a liquid electrode this is easily attainable! The entire tube would be tilted by hand, and with moderate skill a continuous electrically-conductive bead of mercury could be made to flow from the reservoir down to the iron anode. It would be allowed to touch the anode thus directly short-circuiting the lamp.",
						"The lamp would then be tilted back to its original orientation, and a small arc struck between the anode and the bead of mercury as soon as contact was broken. It was then a simple matter to allow the mercury to run back down to its reservoir at the opposite end, thereby drawing the arc up to the full length of the discharge tube. It was a requirement to burn lamps at a slight angle with the mercury reservoir at the lowest point to ensure that the liquid electrode remained in its proper location thereafter. The complete manual ignition process is illustrated in Figure 13."

						"The troublesome effort of having to manually tilt every lamp in an installation to ignite the discharge is easy to appreciate, and it was not long before automatic methods were devised to electro-magnetically or pneumatically tilt the lamps and start them without human intervention. Of course, such methods were still rather cumbersome, and eventually a more scientifically orientated ignition method was devised.",
						"Self-striking lamps were provided with an electrically conductive coating on the outside upper surface of the glass bulb directly above the mercury reservoir, so that there was a vacuum space between this external 'electrode' and the mercury in the lower portion of the tube. The conductive coating was connected directly to the anode at the opposite end of the tube - the intention being to increase the electric field strength above the mercury pool. The external electrode usually took the form of a ring of conductive paint applied to the bulb, but sometimes a wire hoop in close proximity to the bulb was employed, the general arrangement being illustrated in Figure 14.",
						"In parallel with the lamp was wired a miniature mercury tilt switch, essentially a tiny scaled-down Cooper-Hewitt lamp itself, known as the 'shifter'. The  shifter would be physically located directly alongside the series-wired inductive ballast which controlled the discharge current of the main lamp, and orientated such that in its resting position its own mercury dose would directly short-circuit the main lamp. Then on energising the system, a high current would flow through the windings of the inductance coil, bypassing the lamp by means of the mercury shifter which was short-circuiting it, the flow of current generating a strong magnetic field around the windings of the coil. The shifter was mounted very lightly such that it would be influenced by this magnetic field, causing it to tilt and drain its mercury charge to  one end, thus breaking the circuit. The magnetic field built up around the windings would then collapse to zero at an extremely rapid rate, thereby inducing a high voltage kick which was sufficient to ionise the space between the mercury cathode and the external anode in the main lamp. (Incidentally, no ionisation takes place in the mercury shifter tube because it is itself wired in series with another small resistance, such that the route of lowest resistance is not through the shifter tube, but across the main lamp and its external electrode).",
						"The small arc occurring above the mercury pool in the main lamp was sufficient to generate a good deal of mercury vapour and ionise it, and almost instantaneously the arc would then jump from the small external anode to the main internal anode electrode at the opposite end of the tube (of course, this proved a route of lower resistance since the main anode is internal, whereas the small external anode ring is dielectrically separated by the glass bulb).",
						"If the lamp struck successfully then the magnetic field around the windings of the inductance coil would be quickly restored and it was still sufficiently great to hold the mercury shifter in its open-circuit position. However if the lamp did not strike up on its first attempt, the shifter would fall back to its resting position and short-circuit the lamp again, this entire process repeating itself as many times as was necessary until the lamp was successfully lit. A typical wiring diagram for the whole automatic starting arrangement is illustrated in Figure 15.",
						"The system of employing the external electrode plus auxiliary mercury shifter proved to be extremely reliable. Oil-filled or quick-acting circuit breakers were often tried as an alternative to the mercury shifter but proved temperamental and would not work all of the time. It is interesting to note that a higher induced voltage will be produced by the inductance coil for whichever device breaks the current flow through it the most rapidly - the magnitude of the high voltage kick of course depending on how rapidly the magnetic field around the windings collapses. Here the mercury shifter has an advantage, accounted for by the uniquely rapid deionisation of cold mercury vapour and the heat-dissipating properties of its volatile contact points. It was also observed that the colder the shifter, the more effective it would be. In hot weather the shifter would contain a greater pressure of mercury vapour itself, which resulted in a slower breaking of the circuit and less reliable lamp ignition (but still more reliable than any other form of rapid-acting circuit breaker)."

						"The fabrication of Cooper-Hewitt lamps was carried out completely by manual glassblowing operations, and while this alone is a fascinating topic, of greater interest is the unique method by which the lamps were exhausted and dosed with mercury.",
						"When ready for exhausting the lamps would be charged with about twice the required quantity of mercury, and hung vertically in an upright gas furnace or a hot air oven. The lamp was attached to an ordinary vacuum system via a small glass exhaust tube affixed to the upper end of the lamp just beside the iron anode. A plain rotary vacuum pump, which could evacuate the tube to a pressure of around 0.1 torr, was entirely suitable for the operation. A large mercury trap was placed in-line between the lamp and pump to prevent mercury transport back into the pump.",
						"The ovens would then be ignited, gradually raising the temperature of the glass to outgas it and also bringing the mercury slowly up to its boiling temperature. The relatively heavy mercury vapour would then begin to rise up from the reservoir at the bottom of the lamp, and like a piston, would push all air, water vapour and foreign gases up to the top of the tube and out of the lamp. As the temperature continued to rise and the glass was brought perilously close to its softening temperature, the mercury would begin to boil vigorously and the lamp itself was turned into a highly efficient mercury vapour diffusion pump, producing its own high vacuum devoid of all volatile substances except the mercury itself, which was present in great excess.",
						"Simultaneously an alternating current arc would be struck inside the lamp at a potential of some 4000 to 6000 Volts, further heating the boiling mercury cathode and rendering the iron anode incandescent at white-heat to ensure that it was thoroughly outgassed.The fabrication of Cooper-Hewitt lamps was carried out completely by manual glassblowing operations, and while this alone is a fascinating topic, of greater interest is the unique method by which the lamps were exhausted and dosed with mercury.",
						"When a measured quantity of mercury had been boiled out of the lamp and collected in the trap, the process would be stopped and the exhaust tube quickly melted over while all was still hot, thus sealing the remainder of the mercury inside the lamp under ultra-high vacuum. Thereafter the pressure inside the lamp is related only to the cold spot temperature of the mercury - some 357Â°C in operation, the boiling point of mercury under vacuum. Because of this limitation the pressure inside Cooper-Hewitt lamps rarely ever rose above 1 torr when in operation."

						"Until 1932 illumination with mercury lighting had been a complicated affair with unreliable lamps that required horrendously complex control systems. They were a true nightmare to manufacture, and they also gave a poor quality of light with only a moderately good system efficiency. As a result they were confined exclusively to areas which either needed a very large amount of light and the colour quality was of no concern (i.e. in photo-printing shops), or for use as ultra-violet sources in special laboratory and medical applications.",
						'That all changed in June 1932 when the Osram division of the General Electric Company of England unveiled its new "Osira" lamp which was to revolutionise the future of electric discharge lighting worldwide. It was the first time that a discharge lamp had been offered in a compact, clean and efficient package which customers could instantly appreciate how to use in new applications with the utmost simplicity. A 1933 advertisement for the new lamp is reproduced in Figure 18 to the right.',
						"So many of the features on which virtually all modern discharge lamps rely were introduced at this time, indeed it would not be inaccurate to describe this British development as the first practical discharge lamp on which nearly all modern descendents are based in one way or another. It introduced many 'firsts', for instance: An arc tube  sealed within in a transparent outer bulb for thermal insulation. A simple single-ended design with screw cap for ease of installation. An unsaturated vapour in which the entire mercury dose is vaporised. A compact arc to facilitate its use in ordinary optical systems. A hot cathode to enable high power loadings. A simple starting system which relies on no moving parts. Operation from a  simple choke-type ballast",
						"On the following pages in this section, full details pertaining to the first lamp and the first installation of mercury streetlighting can be found, and the complete development of the MA Medium Pressure Mercury lamp is followed right up to the time at which it was eventually superseded by higher pressure MB versions."

						"The first truly successful mercury lamp to operate at a high pressure was invented and developed by The General Electric Company of England during the years 1923-1932. It was marketed later that year, although remarkably the fact that it employed mercury vapour was kept secret until 1933 when lamps became available in  quantity and competitors began to introduce their own equivalents. Until that time it was known simply as the \"Osira\" Luminous Tube lamp. In later terminology it was classified as the MA lamp, 'M' standing for Mercury and 'A' signifying a medium-pressure discharge operating in a glass tube with a power loading of more than ten watts per centimetre of arc length. Incidentally the name Osira was introduced because until the second world war, the GEC was only licensed to use its Osram brand name on metal filament incandescent lamps. It had been granted that right by the German firm Osram many years earlier because the GEC was responsible for manufacturing and marketing metal filament incandescent lamps according to Osram's design throughout the British Empire - but it was only permitted to use the name on those products. This imposition fell at the time of the second world war                 and thereafter, all GEC lamps bore the Osram name.",
						"The GEC knew that mercury lighting could be efficient on account of the performance of the lamps made by Cooper-Hewitt and KÃ¼ch &amp; Retschinsky, but neither of those products was of practical use for general lighting applications.",
						"In 1923 a research effort began at the Hirst Research Laboratories in Wembley to improve upon these crude early designs and develop a new lamp which would overcome most of their shortcomings, creating a market for itself as a real alternative to the incandescent lamp in everyday applications. It was quickly identified that the following key points would have to be satisfied in order to realise such a lamp: A mercury vapour pressure of at least one atmosphere. Complete vaporisation of the whole mercury dose for improved lamp stability. A glass tube capable of continuous operation at a minimum of 600Â°C. Highly emissive electrodes to carry a high lamp current for at least 1000 hours. A means of insulation to protect the discharge tube from draughts of cold air. Compact dimensions to facilitate its use in standard optical systems",
						'The GEC scientists theorised that such a lamp would attain a luminous efficacy 3 times greater than that of the tungsten filament lamps, and that its colour would be improved to the point that it was suitable, at least, for street and industrial lighting. They promptly set about designing a lamp along these principles which would be a satisfactory replacement for the thousand-watt tungsten lamp, the workhorse of industrial and area lighting at the time. Many other discharge lamps were conceived during this period of intense research, the basis of the fluorescent tube and the hot-cathode neon lamp to name a few, but the real fruits of their work came in 1932 in the form of the "Osira" mercury lamp pictured below.',
						"At the heart of the lamp is an arc tube fabricated from a new Aluminosilicate glass developed by the GEC specifically for this lamp. The electrode requirements were met through a modification of the old Wehnelt cathode, and consist of a pelleted mixture of barium, calcium and strontium silicates held in a heavy coil of tungsten wire. The spacing between the electrodes is 182mm, the inside diameter of the arc tube 34mm, and it contains 5 torr of argon plus a few milligrams of mercury. In operation the entire mercury dose is vaporised and the arc tube attains a temperature of around 550Â°C, the coldest spot still being in excess of 360Â°C and this delivers a mercury vapour pressure of precisely one atmosphere (nearly four times greater than had ever been achieved in a practical lamp). Because all of the mercury is vaporised in operation, changes in ambient temperature or supply voltage have very little effect on lamp performance because they cannot cause more or less mercury to be vaporised into the discharge. The arc tube is housed in a sealed, nitrogen-filled tube to protect it from cold draughts of air which could influence the mercury pressure (note the pip top), the resulting lamp being equipped with a GES (E40s) screw cap and measuring 50mm in diameter by 300mm long.",
						"The new lamp operated at 400 Watts  delivering 14,400 lumens, and had a life of 1,200 hours. Thus not only had it succeeded in matching the output of the 1000W tungsten lamp, it achieved this with less than half the power consumption - its luminous efficacy being 36 lm/W. The high mercury vapour pressure ensured that although the spectrum was still completely devoid of any red wavelengths, the blue intensity had decreased to levels which made its colour acceptable for street and industrial lighting. The precise spectral power distribution of the 400W MA lamp is shown in Figure 20 to the right."

						"On the 22nd June 1932, history was made when the worlds first mercury vapour street lighting installation was switched on. The light source was the Osira 400W MA lamp which had been developed by The General Electric Company of England that year, and the location was East Lane in London, just outside the Hirst Research Laboratories and Wembley lamp works of that company. The lanterns were simple protective globes of clear glass which afforded no optical control, but nevertheless the effect was particularly striking. The new lamps lit the street with an efficacy 2.5 times greater than the 1000-watt tungsten lamps they replaced, bathing the road in a daylight colour light with spectacular intensity.",
						"Not surprisingly the installation sparked considerable interest not just within the Corporation of London, but throughout the whole country and indeed internationally as well. City engineers travelled from all over the world to witness the striking brilliancy with which these innovative new lamps were lighting the road.",
						"This first installation was merely an experimental trial for the GEC, and within a few months it became clear that it should be conducted more scientifically, with new lanterns developed specifically to work with the tall  column of light created by the Osira lamps, which had to be burned vertically. On the 2nd March 1933 an improved installation was put into service on the adjacent Watford Road (Figure 21).",
						"Forty-six units were employed over a one-mile stretch of the road, and a new unit of highly original appearance, the Watford Road lantern, was designed for the Osira lamps. The lantern is shown both by day and by night in Figure 21. It was noted straight away that owing to the fact that the light was generated from a tall vertical column of luminous vapour, rather than the tiny compact source of filament lamps, that the arc itself was conducive to soft shadows and good diffusion. The overall level of visibility was said to be quite excellent."

						"The early days of MA lamp production was a time of intensive research and development, with work concentrating in two separate fields - firstly, methods had to be found to de-skill the production of the lamps and bring their price down. The principal developments on that topic are explained in the section on lamp manufacture. Secondly, there was a tremendous drive to further increase the performance of the lamps in just about every aspect - these being the subject of this page.",
						"In view of the tremendous luminous efficacy of the first 400W MA lamp, customers wasted no time in requesting lamps of different wattages to extend the range of applications. A 250W version soon followed and by 1939 a larger 650W model had also been brought into production. But customers were not satisfied with these ratings alone, what they really wanted was a much lower wattage so that the mercury lamp could be introduced to replace ordinary tungsten lamps.",
						"To meet this demand lampmakers created the 150W MA lamp in 1936, but the reason for the delay soon became obvious. Its efficacy was considerably reduced for two reasons. Firstly, when smaller lamps are made, the volt drop across the arc should really be allowed to decrease but this could not be tolerated because it made brought with it an increase in lamp current. This made the ballast very inefficient due to increased Joule heating of its windings when run at such a high current. The lamp volts had to be held inconveniently high and a reduced current was required to make the lower wattage possible, this decreasing the power loading in the arc. Figure 23 shows how lamp efficacy falls with reduced loading.",
						"Secondly, the electrical losses occurring just in front of the electrodes are of a similar magnitude whatever the lamp wattage, so although the wattage dissipated in the arc column was decreased, the electrode losses remained substantially the same, meaning that these losses become more significant for the smaller lamps. This phenomenon is explained more fully in the section on lamp electrodes. As a result luminous efficacy always becomes progressively worse for lower wattage lamps of any type, this rule being applicable to all discharge lamps. The 150W MA lamp was not a commercial success, and enjoyed only a few years in production. The introduction of lower wattage mercury products had to wait a few years until the development of the MB style lamp made it feasible with higher efficacy, as described in the next section.",
						"Meanwhile manufacturers concentrated on developing the high wattage market, where efficacy of course becomes higher for larger lamps. A 1000W lamp joined the range in 1939 (this was a bare arc tube type), and in the USA a very long high voltage 3000W lamp soon followed (type H-9). It operated at 535V with a lamp current of 6.25A, the arc length being 1220mm and the tube diameter 30mm. Essentially it can be thought of as eight 400W arc tubes connected together end-to-end, the wattage being slightly lower than 8 x 400W on account of the fact that there are only power losses from two electrodes, rather than from the sixteen electrodes that would be used in eight 400W lamps. The voltage also was lower to account for the fact that the volt drop of only one rather than eight pairs of electrodes was present. Its rather unwieldy dimensions confined it to industrial lighting areas with very high ceilings, but its length was found to be an advantage in photo-printing shops.",
						'In the UK attention was directed at high wattage lamps of more compact dimensions and 2500W types were employed in many trial installations, but were never marketed on a large scale. These had a high efficacy of 52lm/W derived from a much more compact arc 400mm in length with a tube diameter of 65mm. The lamp voltage was 145 Volts and the current 18.5 Amps. Although the arc bows upwards about 1/2" above the tube axis when used horizontally, it is prevented from touching the discharge tube wall by the field produced in the return lead which is affixed to the top of the arc tube. An experimental BTH 2500W lamp for industrial floodlighting is pictured in Figure 24.',
						"Some of the more common technical specifications for the range of British MA lamps is detailed in Table 1 below. All figures relate to 1950 lamps designed for a 230 / 240 V A.C. mains electricity supply. Source - Electric Lamp Manufacturers Association, Electric Discharge Lamp Sub-Committee, Internal Agreed Data for Group IX Lamps.",
						"The first MA lamps were strictly classified as the type MA/V, the V implying that they were suitable only for burning vertically in the cap-up position. A similar MA/D lamp was also made available, this type being suitable for vertical cap-down use. The difference was quite simply that the arc tube was inverted, such that the tip-off where its exhaust tube is sealed off from the vacuum system would always be on the upper end of the arc tube. The reason for this is because temperatures can be a little lower inside this tip-off area, and mercury can condense here with the effect that it is not all vaporised into the discharge so the the lamp might not run up to full power. Because heat rises, it is prudent to locate this tip-off at the uppermost end of the arc tube where it is less likely to present a cold spot and interfere with lamp performance.",
						"Vertical operation is rather inconvenient though on account of the complex luminaire designs that are required to redirect the light and send it down onto the horizontal plane, especially for streetlighting lanterns. Horizontal operation is much more desirable, but could not be tolerated. In the MA lamp the central cord of the arc is at a very high temperature while the outer periphery is much cooler, and this temperature differential sets up strong convection currents. In the horizontal position these are sufficiently strong to cause the arc to be swept upwards at its centre, bringing it into direct contact with the wall of the discharge tube. The elevated temperatures this would cause could not be tolerated, since the discharge tube glass would soften and blister outwards on account of the positive internal pressure. Lamp failure would quickly ensue. A photograph illustrating this upward bow is shown in Figure 25.",
						"Since the arc itself is in effect a flexible electric conductor, and all conductors are influenced by the presence of a magnetic field, a system was conceived by BTH whereby the arc could be forced back down near to the centre of the discharge tube by an external electromagnet. By wiring this electromagnet in series with the lamp the alternating field it produces is of course automatically brought into phase with the discharge current, and by correctly positioning the deflection coil it is most effective at preventing the arc from touching the discharge tube wall. This kind of magnetic deflection  proved very popular in Great Britain and thereafter, the vast majority of streetlighting lanterns switched over to horizontally burning lamps.",
						"Typical deflectors only consumed about 3 to 5 Watts but had to be precisely located to be effective and soon came to be seen as a cumbersome and heavy addition to many luminaires. Lampmakers therefore directed their attention to making a new lamp which could burn horizontally without the deflector, this resulting in the MA/H type. By reducing the quantity of mercury per unit of arc length, the speed of the convection currents in the arc tube are reduced and the effect of this is to minimise the upward bow of the arc. It was a combination of this and an arc tube 2mm larger in diameter that led to the introduction of the MA/H lamp. However the lower mercury vapour pressure in these designs and their lower volt drop meant that their luminous efficacy was about 10% less than for vertical burning types. This sacrifice was felt to be worthwhile in view of the fact that simple low-cost luminaires could then be created, which made up for the loss of lamp performance through the ability to employ more efficient optical systems.",
						"In the early 1950's a new kind of lamp was placed on the market, this being the MA/U designed for universal burning without any deflection coil. It was made possible through the development of a new glass type having a softening temperature approximately 50Â°C higher than the original kind. In addition the arc length was slightly shortened and this reduced the extent to which it would bow upwards. Consequently it could be burned horizontally without fear of overheating. The quantity of mercury per unit arc length was almost as much as in the first MA/V types so efficacy was high, and as a result it was capable of superseding both previous types of lamp. Horizontal efficacy was still 10% lower than vertical due to convection losses, but it matched the performance of each of the dedicated MA/H and MA/V lamps and was therefore able to supersede them both.",
						"Since the inception of the mercury lamp, attempts were made by numerous methods to improve its colour rendering properties. Right from the start the GEC had considered adding various other metals to the mercury arc which would provide some radiation at the red end of the spectrum, and a lamp containing cadmium and zinc in addition to mercury was trialled. This increased the red ratio of the lamp from 1% to about 2%, effectively doubling the small amount of red light present. Such lamps were never marketed though in the MA format - firstly, these additive metals radiated many lines in the UV and IR parts of the spectrum and the efficacy of the mercury discharge was reduced by some 15%. In addition early lamps made with these additions suffered rapid blackening of the arc tube and a useful service life could not be attained.",
						"Attention was therefore focussed on a fluorescent mercury lamp instead, in which the inside of the outer bulb was coated with a fluorescent substance. Ideally the material should absorb ultraviolet wavelengths and re-radiate them in the red part of the spectrum to improve the colour rendering. In 1937 a so-called MAF lamp was placed on the market, based on a fluorescent coating of zinc cadmium sulphide. This lamp is described fully under the section relating to sulphide phosphors.",
						"An alternative and highly innovative solution to the problem of colour correction was presented in 1935 by Dr. J.N. Aldington and Mr. W.H. Le MarÃ©chal of the British Siemens Bros. company (of no connection to Siemens of Germany). Thirty years earlier Peter Cooper-Hewitt had proven than ordinary incandescent lamps of an appropriate rating could be successfully employed as a ballast for the mercury discharge, and that their excess of red light perfectly complemented the bluish light of the mercury discharge. But it was the aforementioned Siemens men who were first to combine arc tube and filament all within one outer bulb though, creating the first mercury lamp which did not require an external ballast and which also had excellent colour rendering properties."

						"The first MA lamp had only two electrodes, simply to sustain the main arc and nothing else.&nbsp; To cause the initial breakdown in the discharge tube and ionise the gas filling a high voltage gradient is always required, the precise voltage depending on fill pressure of the argon gas, and on the ratio between the length and diameter of the discharge tube.&nbsp; Naturally the argon pressure is chosen to give the lowest breakdown voltage, and although the length to diameter ratio is quite low for MA lamps, the effect of wall charges means that the ordinary mains voltage is not high enough to strike the discharge on its own.&nbsp; In practice, most 400W MA lamps would require a pulse of 300-500V to initiate the discharge if no auxiliary method was employed to lower this value.&nbsp; In the first experimental installations of MA lamps the voltage pulse was provided by a small Tesla coil included in the control circuitry.&nbsp; The method was crude though and the incorporation of a Tesla transformer into each lighting fitting would have added great expense and inconvenience, so it was superseded in readiness for the first commercial installation with MA Mercury lamps.",
						"By locating a third small electrode in very close proximity to one of the main electrodes, the striking voltage of the lamp can be considerably reduced by virtue of the fact that the gap between these two electrodes is small, so the voltage gradient between them is high and the gas filling is easier to break down.&nbsp; The standard method is to include a simple tungsten or molybdenum wire directly beside the main electrode at the cap end of the arc tube.&nbsp; This is connected via a high resistance (approximately 50 kW) to the main electrode at the opposite end of the tube.&nbsp; The principal of operation is exactly the same as for the self-starting Cooper-Hewitt lamps already described.&nbsp; In the MA case however, the starting electrode is inside the arc tube so no high voltage kick is required - ionisation between the main electrode and the adjacent auxiliary takes place at normal operating voltages, the lamp striking voltage being lowered to as little as 100V in some cases.&nbsp; There is more than enough safety margin between this and the usual 240V mains supply voltage to ensure that ignition will always take place even during dips in the mains voltage, in colder atmospheres or later in lamp life when the striking voltage always tends to rise by a small amount.",
						"A small glow discharge is easily initiated between the starting electrode and the main electrode beside it, the discharge current being limited to approximately one thousandth of the normal lamp current by the resistor.&nbsp; Once ionisation has taken place in the vicinity of the auxiliary electrode, the tube becomes conducting and the arc moves almost instantly across the two main electrodes, because there is no resistance in this path.&nbsp; The same principle continues to be employed in all modern mercury and many metal halide lamps as well.&nbsp; A diagram of the self-starting MA arc tube and the wiring arrangement to the auxiliary electrode is shown in Figure 26.",
						"In the early days, the inclusion of a third auxiliary electrode was seen as rather tedious, adding cost and technical complexity to the lamp with the added chance that owing to the presence of an extra glass-to-metal seal, cracking of the arc tube was more likely resulting in an unreliable lamp design.&nbsp; Many experiments were therefore conducted with external starting electrodes, British Siemens and GE of America being the principal investigators of this field.",
						"In the most simple designs, a few turns of thin wire were looped around one end of the arc tube and connected to the electrode at the opposite end.&nbsp; One of the first Siemens designs is illustrated in Figure 27.&nbsp; Later this was improved upon by passing a thin strip of wire mesh around the outside of the tube and welding it to the arc tube support frame, which was connected to the main electrode at the opposite end.",
						"The effect of this was to neutralise the so-called 'grid effect' caused by wall charges on the arc tube that normally kept the striking voltage higher than would be expected, and the external electrode was able to produce ionisation inside the discharge tube due to the capacitance between this and the internal main electrode.&nbsp; This very considerably reduces the required striking voltage to a level which is usually attainable from the mains electricity supply.&nbsp; However at ordinary mains frequencies of 50-60Hz it is not completely effective, the internal electrode remaining much more reliable.&nbsp; Consequently the external starting electrode was only widely used for lamps which were operated on a high frequency supply  such as the MBM Coal Mining lamp, or on lamps designed for operation on a high supply voltage as in the case of Philips' first MB lamp."

						"After switching on the lamp, the discharge strikes initially in an atmosphere of argon and low pressure mercury.&nbsp; For the first minute or so the light output is pitifully small and the colour noticeably blue.&nbsp; The efficiency of visible light generation is very small when the mercury vapour pressure is low, because ultraviolet lines dominate the spectrum.&nbsp; Another characteristic of the low pressure state is that the discharge fills the entire arc tube diameter with a diffuse glow, the efficacy being around 3 lm/W (Fig. 28.)",
						"Since the mercury vapour pressure is very low at this time (about 0.002 torr), the electrical characteristics of the discharge are determined mainly by the argon gas filling.&nbsp; The resistance is practically zero so the voltage drop across the arc is  low, typically 20V or so, and the current is as high as the ballast can provide under what are effectively short-circuit conditions.&nbsp; Typically the starting current is around 1.7 times the normal lamp current.&nbsp; For a 400W lamp this starting current is 5.5 to 6A, and the power in the arc tube is about 100W.",
						"This high current must of course be carried by the electrodes and the period just after ignition is particularly damaging.&nbsp; This is why frequent switching reduces lamp life.",
						"As time progresses, the heat produced by this discharge begins to vaporise some of the mercury dose.&nbsp; The effect of this is to increase the voltage drop across the arc tube and more power is dissipated in the lamp so that its wattage increases.&nbsp; The increase in voltage is slow at first owing to the low power dissipation in the tube, but as more mercury is vaporised the power increases and the remainder of the mercury is evaporated more quickly, raising the lamp voltage simultaneously.&nbsp; As lamp wattage rises, so does the luminous flux.&nbsp; Similarly as lamp voltage rises, the current gradually falls to the normal operating value, relieving the load on the electrodes.&nbsp;",
						"Once all of the mercury has been evaporated the voltage drop thereafter becomes practically constant.&nbsp; The discharge tube still continues to heat up, and as no more mercury is available to be evaporated, the quantity which has already been vaporised is then said to enter superheat conditions.&nbsp; The wattage continues to rise a little higher, further increasing the mercury pressure and improving the efficacy and colour properties.&nbsp; Final operating pressure is determined by the temperature of the coldest spot of the arc tube, usually just behind the electrodes.&nbsp; Because of this it is desirable to make the gap between the back of the electrodes and the end of the arc tube as short as possible.&nbsp; The precise gap here is limited by the strength of the glass, which will crack if it becomes too hot in the area of the glass-to-metal seal.&nbsp; A temperature of 360Â°C is the maximum value attainable in practice, and this corresponds to a mercury vapour pressure of precisely one atmosphere. At such high pressure the arc becomes constricted into a narrow cord of high brightness, as is clearly visible in Figure 28.",
						"The whole running-up process takes about 9 minutes in the original designs of MA lamp, but is reduced for later models.&nbsp; If the mercury vapour pressure can be made to increase more rapidly then the lamp will run up faster, and in later lamps this was accomplished by applying a specular mirror of heat-reflecting platinum onto the ends of the arc tube just behind the electrodes to prevent heat losses here.&nbsp; The coating is always painted on in the form of platinum chloride which happens to be soluble in lavender oil, the resulting mixture being decomposed to a bright metal film by heating in air at around 500Â°C for 30 minutes.&nbsp; The effect is to reduce the run-up time to approximately 6 minutes in the case of 400W lamps, and 7 minutes for the 250W size.&nbsp; Faster run-up is advantageous not only for practical reasons, but because it takes the electrodes out of the high-load condition more rapidly and maximises their lifetime while reducing the rate of arc tube blackening.&nbsp; The location of the platinum coating is shown in Figure 29.",
						"Illustrated in Figure 30 below is a graph showing how the voltage, current, wattage and luminous flux change while the MA type lamp is warming up to full power.&nbsp; If there is an interruption to the mains electricity supply and the arc extinguishes, it cannot be re-ignited straight away as the striking voltage of of mercury vapour rises very rapidly with increasing pressure.&nbsp; 5,000 to 10,000V is required to instantly re-strike a hot 400W MA lamp.&nbsp; Typically 10 minutes is required for the lamp to cool back down to a level at which the mains voltage will be sufficiently high to re-ignite it.&nbsp; There is then a further delay while the lamp runs back up to its full intensity again."

						"Developments in glass technology, a field in which the GEC had tremendous expertise, are what ultimately led to the feasibility of the MA lamp.&nbsp; In the Cooper-Hewitt lamps borosilicate had been employed, but it was not possible to run this at a particularly high temperature and consequently a high mercury pressure could not be built up.&nbsp; Quartz was known from the Spanner and Bastian lamps which evolved from the KÃ¼ch &amp; Retschinsky developments, and although this was more than suitable in terms of its refractory properties, its  thermal expansion coefficient was so low that no satisfactory method of sealing metal conductors through it was known.&nbsp; The techniques which were employed were all extremely tedious and frequently cracked or leaked, thus the quartz lamps could only be used in applications where they did not have to be relied on as a source of light, confining them mainly to medical and scientific applications.",
						"The GEC Glassworks at Lemington and the glass technologists at Wembley were therefore charged with developing a glass which was more refractory than borosilicate, but which still had a high coefficient of thermal expansion so that metal wires could be sealed through it.&nbsp; It was also required to have a high electrical resistivity at the elevated temperatures it was to operate at, and it had to resist any chemical attack from superheated mercury vapour and oxide coatings originating from the electrodes.&nbsp; This occupied the bulk of the period spent in developing the MA lamp, but was outstandingly successful.&nbsp; A new family of glasses called the aluminosilicates were developed expressly for this application, resulting in the GEC's popular H26X glass type.",
						"Essentially the principal component of borosilicate glasses, boric oxide, had been substituted with aluminium oxide.&nbsp; This had the effect of increasing the softening temperature by a crucial 200Â°C, and the coefficient of thermal expansion actually rose slightly above that of the borosilicates.&nbsp; It was found to be perfectly suitable for sealing directly to lightly oxidised molybdenum wire.&nbsp; The higher expansion awkwardly made the glass more sensitive to thermal shock, and in consideration of this protracted annealing schedules had to be introduced every time the glass was heated up to softening temperatures.&nbsp; In this respect aluminosilicate is perhaps the most hated material of glass technologists, it seemed you only had to frown at a batch of finished lamps and they'd promptly crack!&nbsp; Nevertheless with care, it could be worked and techniques were found to reliably seal molybdenum conductors through it.",
						"Shortly after Osram showed the Osira lamp, British Thomson-Houston became active in making aluminosilicate glasses and was soon manufacturing its own C14 grade at the Chesterfield glassworks.&nbsp; The expansion coefficient was 37x10-7 m/Â°C and the softening temperature was 730Â°C, derived from a glass comprising 58.5% Silica, 22.5% Alumina, 3.0% Boric Oxide, 15.2% Oxides of Mg, Ba and Ca, and 0.8% Oxides of Na and K.",
						"In the following years BTH devoted great efforts to further increase the softening temperature of its aluminosilicate glasses, the efforts of J.E. Stanworth and A.E. Dale at the BTH Research Laboratory in Rugby being especially significant.&nbsp; Many of the principal technical papers covering this important period of development were authored by these scientists.&nbsp; In the late 1940's the new Chesterfield C37 glass was introduced, in which the softening temperature was raised to 760Â°C and this permitted a further increase in lamp efficacy.&nbsp; In 1950 the C46 glass made its debut, again offering higher performance with a softening temperature of 775Â°C.&nbsp; This last development was important because it meant that for the first time, an efficient lamp which was suitable for universal burning in any orientation could be made.&nbsp; Previously when lamps were burned horizontally, the upward bow of the arc due to convection currents required that an external magnetic deflector be used to prevent the arc from overheating and destroying the arc tube.&nbsp; Until the advent of C46 glass, special lamps were designed for horizontal operation with a larger diameter arc tube and lower mercury dose which meant that their luminous efficacy fell slightly.&nbsp; The new harder C46 glass was just able to tolerate the higher wall temperatures present in horizontally-burned lamps of the standard pattern though, and one universal burning lamp could be marketed which offered full efficiency in either horizontal or vertical orientations.",
						"In the USA the production of aluminosilicates was adopted first by General Electric in 1934, this company having a full patent licensing agreement with BTH so that both companies could immediately make use of each others developments.&nbsp; Corning Glassworks of New York soon took up the manufacture of similar aluminosilicate glasses as well, these being supplied to Westinghouse and Sylvania to enable those firms to also enter the mercury lamp business."

						"There was little point in having a new glass which could endure such a high loading if there did not exist a method of carrying suitably large currents into the lamp to develop this high loading.&nbsp; All previous lamps had relied on a liquid mercury electrode, but this was no longer possible since the increased pressure in MA lamps required them to&nbsp; operate at temperatures so high that any mercury would be completely vaporised.",
						"The only practical way to inject high currents into such a lamp is by means of a hot cathode, which emits copious quantities of electrons at its elevated operating temperature due to the principle of thermionic emission.&nbsp; Osram-GEC had been working on hot cathodes in an attempt to increase the power density of linear neon and fluorescent lamps, and the company was also well experienced in the use of similar electrodes at its Marconi-Osram Valve works, which shared the same premises as the lamp works in Hammersmith, London, for the manufacture of radio valves and other electronic tubes.&nbsp; There was no shortage of knowledge in this field and a new cathode was soon developed that met the particularly severe requirements of the mercury lamp.&nbsp;",
						"Had pure heated tungsten been used it would have run ridiculously hot and been evaporated and sputtered away rapidly, staining the arc tube black and absorbing much of the light the lamp generated.&nbsp; This is because  tungsten has a high 'work function', in other words large amounts of energy are necessary to eject electrons from its surface, the energy being wasted as heat and without contributing to the light output of the lamp.&nbsp; This&nbsp; leads to a large voltage gradient immediately in front of the cathode which is emitting negatively charged electrons and receiving positively charged ions.&nbsp; The high electric field strength, called the cathode fall, accelerates these ions into the electrode at high velocity and because of their great mass they bombard it with significant force, physically destroying the electrode by sputtering it and further exacerbating the arc tube blackening problem mentioned above.&nbsp; Lamp life is dependent upon the rate at which the electrodes are gradually obliterated by this continual process.&nbsp; The electrode must therefore be designed in such a way that it can receive these ions while suffering the least possible damage.&nbsp; The way to accomplish this is to reduce the work function of the electrode so that it emits electrons freely, the volt drop ahead of it then being minimised, and the ions can be received with minimal impact.&nbsp; The principle is illustrated diagramatically in Figure 31.",
						"Other metals have lower work functions than tungsten, but are not so refractory and cannot endure the high temperatures present in the lamp without melting or physically evaporating, which leads to the same blackening problem.&nbsp; The electrode requirements were eventually met through a modification of the old Wehnelt cathode, developed in Germany in 1904.&nbsp; Wehnelt had identified that the thermionic emission from a heated wire is very considerably increased if it is coated with a layer of barium oxide.&nbsp; It now known that is due to the formation of a monolayer of barium metal over the surface of the wire, just one atom thick, these coatings having an extremely low work function value.&nbsp; In modern electrodes, barium oxide is often employed with the oxides of strontium and calcium, which have the effect of reducing the rate of evaporation of barium.&nbsp; Thorium oxide is often employed as well to further reduce the work function.",
						"An electron-emissive pellet of barium-calcium-strontium oxide was located at the heart of the electrode in the first Osira lamp, this imparting a very low work function to the electrode and enabling it to run at a relatively low temperature at which the effects of evaporation and sputtering are minimised. The pellet was located loosely inside a coil of tungsten wire and the electrode assemblies of this first lamp are pictured in Figure 32.&nbsp; Owing to the small diameter of the tungsten wire that was used the electrode still ran at a rather high temperature, and an improved design was soon introduced.&nbsp; Much heavier tungsten wire was used, and the pellet, protected inside this first coil, was then inserted into a second coil forming the main electrode.&nbsp; Heat was dissipated much better in this design, but still remaining just as effective as an electrode because of the existence of the monolayer over the coils.",
						"For convenience of manufacturing such electrodes, the electron-emissive pellet is never inserted in the form of the raw metal oxides.&nbsp; In the first Osira lamp the pellet was made from a mixture of barium-strontium-calcium silicates, and in nearly all lamps made thereafter the metal carbonates were employed instead.&nbsp; Before these compounds impart any benefit to the cathode they must first be converted to the oxide, and the monolayer of raw metal must be formed over the surface of the tungsten coil by a process known as electrode activation.&nbsp;",
						"The usual practice is to raise the electrodes to a very high temperature while the lamp is on the exhausting machine - either induced heating with a radio frequency oscillator or by passing a heavy electric current through the electrode if its shape permits this.&nbsp; Alternatively the electrodes may be activated by electron bombardment attained by striking a high current AC discharge in the arc tube, or by a combination of both methods.&nbsp; The high temperature treatment decomposes the metal carbonate or silicate to the oxide, the process being continued until all gases evolved during the process have been completely released and pumped away by a vacuum pump to which the arc tube is attached.&nbsp; At this high temperature in vacuum some reduction of the oxide then takes place leading to the formation of free barium metal which diffuses over the surface of the tungsten electrode thus forming the all-important monolayer for good electron emission.&nbsp; Thereafter the activated electrodes must not be allowed to come into contact with any air or oxygen since this would instantly destroy the monolayer and poison the electrodes, rendering them permanently useless.\n                                                                            &nbsp;",
						"During normal lamp operation, evaporation of the monolayer is continuously occurring as is the diffusion of fresh metal out of the pellet held within the coils.&nbsp; The rates of each of these processes is depending on the operating temperature of the electrode and it is important that the electrode for each lamp be designed in such a way that its operating temperature will cause the rate of each process to balance perfectly.&nbsp; If the monolayer is evaporated too quickly, the electrode will become deactivated and it will lose its emission and the lamp will fail.&nbsp; If fresh material is diffused out of the pellet too rapidly then similarly it will be evaporated away as quickly as it is produced, leading to arc tube blackening and premature exhaustion of the pellet again with the consequence that the lamp will fail early.&nbsp;",
						"Much of the scientific work in this field was conducted under Dr. J.N. Aldington of Siemens Electric Lamps &amp; Supplies in Preston, UK (no connection with Siemens of Germany).&nbsp; His research laboratories methodically tested literally hundreds of different electrode arrangements and lamp chemistries to obtain longer, more efficient lamp lives.&nbsp; The extent of the work carried out by Siemens is easy to recognise simply by virtue of the fact that today it is unusual to come across any two Siemens MA lamps of the same construction, practically all have different electrodes, starting aids or methods of assembly.&nbsp; In particular, many hollow cathode designs were investigated as well as different electron-emissive materials, all with the aim of lowering the lamp striking voltage, reducing the rate of arc tube blackening, and increasing electrode life.",
						"One other electrode worthy of mention is the type employed by BTH, in which thorium oxide was also incorporated into the emissive pellet.&nbsp; This, being a mildly radioactive substance, helps to cause ionisation in the discharge tube and lowers the striking voltage that is required."

						"The first Osira lamps were made entirely by hand, starting out essentially with just a plain glass tube.&nbsp; This would be domed over at one end to form a test-tube shaped object, the dome then being pierced with a small hole through which one of the electrodes was inserted, and sealed in by a glassblower with the aid of a gas torch and blowing pipe.&nbsp; Blowing was accomplished through the opposite end of the arc tube which was of course open.&nbsp; Another small hole was then blown beside the first seal, and the auxiliary starting electrode sealed in.&nbsp; Following this yet another hole was made and a short length of exhaust tubing was attached.&nbsp;",
						"Attention was then directed at the opposite open end of the arc tube which had next to be domed over just as was done to the first end.&nbsp; By transferring the blowing pipe to the exhaust tube, a hole could be blown in the heated dome at the second end of the arc tube.&nbsp; The second main electrode was then sealed in, this completing the physical construction of the arc tube. With all processes being carried out by hand a considerable amount of effort went into making the early lamps, reflected in their high sale price.",
						"BTH pioneered a method which considerably increased the speed with which MA arc tubes could be manufactured through a most ingenious innovation.&nbsp; Instead of building the arc tubes from straight glass tubing, the company pre-formed arc tubes to a near-final shape by blowing the glass into a specially shaped mould on automatic Westlake machines.&nbsp; It is easy to tell an arc tube which was made by the improved BTH process, because feint circular lines appear around the circumference of the arc tube, these impressions being left in the glass as a result of it being rotated inside its mould on the bulb-blowing machine.&nbsp; With early arc tubes made from drawn tubing, if there are any lines present in the glass surface they will be running parallel to the axis of the tube, these having been formed as a result of the tube drawing process.",
						"The only tasks requiring manual labour involved the piercing of three small holes in the dome end of the arc tube bulb, the main electrode, auxiliary electrode, and exhaust tube being attached one at a time after each hole was blown.&nbsp; Next, the final electrode was sealed into the constriction at the opposite end of the arc tube, this being a swift and easy process since the dome-ended shape here was almost completely formed.&nbsp; Final arc tube processing was then carried out on an automatic rotary exhausting machine which pumped, baked, illuminated and gas-filled the arc tube.&nbsp; The human touch was retained, however, for the tipping-off process in which the exhaust tube was melted over by hand-torch to remove the arc tube from the pumping machine - the precise shape of the tip being quite important for good lamp performance.&nbsp; The principal production stages for the blown-bulb arc tubes are illustrated below.",
						"Lamps made with these machine-blown bulbs proved to be quite superior to the earlier models.&nbsp; Aluminosilicate tubing was always hand-drawn prior to this development and despite the fact that a pair of skilled glassblowers could control the diameter of their&nbsp; tubing to within a millimetre of the required size, the tube was often not completely round or might have a slight taper in the wall thickness along its length.&nbsp; This affected the temperature distribution in finished lamps which affected the mercury vapour pressure, and the spread in luminous flux from one lamp to the next was often rather large as a result.&nbsp; The consistency of machine-blown bulbs greatly reduced this variation in lamp performance.&nbsp; As a result BTH was able to increase the average efficacy slightly, knowing that very few if any of the new lamps would be likely to be overloaded, as might have been the case with the uncertainty of hand drawn tubing.",
						"It was Siemens Bros. of Preston who completed the task of mechanising the production of MA arc tubes, through a variation of the aforementioned BTH process.&nbsp; Their method was later copied by Osram-GEC and Crompton, and by Westinghouse in the USA.&nbsp; The shape of the blown-bulb arc tube was modified to include a dimple at its crown.&nbsp; At the lamp works the tip of the dimple was removed, and the lower cullet portion similarly cut away, leaving an arc tube with two open ends having reduced diameters.",
						"One end of the arc tube was next lowered over the electrode assembly in a special pinch-sealing machine.&nbsp; Heat was applied to the constricted end of the arc tube and when the glass had reached its softening temperature, a pair of hammers softly pinched it flat around the lead wires thus forming a neat, good quality seal.&nbsp; The same was repeated at the opposite end of the arc tube and by this method, the production of MA lamps was greatly de-skilled.&nbsp; The consistency of electrode positioning improved and so did lamp performance.&nbsp; Because it was found too difficult to include an exhaust tube in the pinch-seal, this was attached to the arc tube side, again with the aid of a mechanical jig to pierce the hole and then fuse an exhaust tube over it.",
						"For lamps of unusual length or special diameters, a different manufacturing technique was employed since it was not economical to fabricate moulds into which semi-formed bulbs could be blown automatically.&nbsp; This production method was standard practice on the 1000W and 2500W lamps as well, which were not required in such large quantities.&nbsp; The arc tubes were made from drawn tubing, which was first heated at its centre while revolving in a glassblowing lathe.&nbsp; The heated central portion would be constricted inwards and the tube parted into two halves at this point, each half being left with a neatly domed end.",
						"A main electrode was then sealed into one half of the tube, and the other electrode, auxiliary, and exhaust tube attached to the other half of the tube.&nbsp; The two halves were then brought back together again and sealed together at their opposite ends to form the completed arc tube, as in Figure 35 below.",
						"To form a good seal between glass and metal, there are two conditions that must be satisfied.&nbsp; Firstly the softened glass must 'wet' the metal and adhere to it, and secondly the stresses developed by the different rates of expansion and contraction of the components must not exceed the strength of the glass such that the seals crack or leak.&nbsp; Molybdenum and tungsten have similar coefficients of thermal expansion to aluminosilicates, molybdenum being the higher of the two metals.&nbsp; Although tungsten is a better match in terms of the stated expansion coefficients, molybdenum has always been the preference in practical lamps.&nbsp; This is because the glass and metal do not heat up at the same rate when the lamp is switched on - heat is generated at the electrode which is welded to the leading-in wire and consequently this warms up more rapidly than the glass surrounding it.&nbsp; It is found that molybdenum seals are less likely to crack during warming up because of this situation.&nbsp; Glasses used in all but the first MA lamps typically had an expansion coefficient of around 43x10-7 m/Â°C.",
						'In most MA lamps the seals consist of ground moly wires 1.0mm (0.040") in diameter.&nbsp; The wire is of a specially prepared type to ensure that it is free of splits which might allow air to leak into a finished lamp, and thoroughly cleaned usually by an electropolishing method and by furnacing in hydrogen or under vacuum to remove included gases which might otherwise evolve bubbles in the glass seal during formation, possibly leading to cracking.&nbsp; However glasses do not wet pure molybdenum and stick to it, the seal is actually made to a thin layer of oxide of a precisely controlled thickness, formed by first bringing the metal to a cherry-red heat in a small gas flame.&nbsp; The wire is then beaded with a small glass sleeve of the same composition as the arc tube glass, the oxide layer dissolving into the bead and forming an excellent bond.&nbsp; The wire displays a metallic brown or sometimes deep gold colouration if the seal has been formed correctly.&nbsp; It is necessary to pre-sleeve the wires in this fashion, they cannot simply be sealed directly into the arc tube.&nbsp; The level of heat involved in sealing them in is so high that further oxidation would take place and an over-oxidised seal would be formed which would be quite likely to leak in service.',
						'The shape of the glass bead so formed is all-important as this determines the likelihood of a crack forming during lamp life.&nbsp; Some minor cracking is often inevitable and the shape of the bead and the distribution of internal stress must be controlled so that if a crack does form, it will not penetrate right through the wall of the lamp and cause an air leak (Scott, 1945).&nbsp; In final lamp assembly, the sleeved lead wire would then be sealed directly into a small hole which had been formed in the end of the arc tube.&nbsp; Seals of this type were successfully fabricated with wires up to 2.0mm diameter (0.080") for the manufacture of experimental 2,500 Watt MA lamps.',
						"The exhausting process of MA arc tubes was essentially the same for all of the different arc tube construction methods illustrated above.&nbsp; To remove all foreign impurities it was necessary to heat the arc tube to a temperature much higher than its operating temperature while under high vacuum, typical outgassing temperatures being of the order of 700Â°C or so.&nbsp; In the early days arc tubes were heated with a simple gas flame from a hand torch whose flame was cautiously played over the whole arc tube.&nbsp; As production volumes increased rotary automatic pumping machines were devised, very much along the lines of the equipment that had been developed for processing fluorescent tubes.&nbsp; Arc tubes went through several stages on this equipment.&nbsp; First they were pumped to rough vacuum, the vacuum quality gradually increasing as the bulb was heated to as high a temperature as possible without it sucking-in under the vacuum.&nbsp; They were then filled with argon and a high voltage high current AC discharge established in the lamps to render the electrodes brightly incandescent, thus activating the  emissive pellet and driving out impurities.&nbsp; After the baking, pumping and bombarding process the arc tube was given its final dose of spectroscopically pure argon.",
						"Throughout the entire process the tiny dose of mercury had to be kept out of the ovens and in a T-shaped appendage on the side of the exhaust tube - had it been heated it would have vaporised and been pumped away.&nbsp; When the arc tubes were hand-tipped off the exhausting machine, they were long-tipped above the point of the side T-piece.&nbsp; Once off the pump the lamp could be tilted and the mercury dose allowed to run into the arc tube.&nbsp; The long tip and side T-piece were then removed with the mercury inside the arc tube, the shape of the final tip-off being formed by skilled operators with the aid of gas torches."

						"In 1936 Philips announced the successful development of the first kind of MB Mercury lamp. It was called the Philora HP300, illustrated to the right, and it was made possible through a development of the quartz-to-metal seals that were described on the previous page. Instead of employing just one intermediate glass between the tungsten and quartz, several were used in a stack from high to low expansion, and this allowed the seal to operate at higher temperatures and without the slug of mercury in place to protect it. Removing the excess mercury also allowed the lamp to revert to the unsaturated vapour design invented by GEC with the MA lamp, in which the entire mercury dose is vaporised, and a stable discharge could again be developed. Owing to the use of a quartz bulb which could withstand higher operating temperatures, a relatively short arc could be adopted and the high power density which accompanied this led to a lamp of high luminous efficacy.\n\tThe first lamp consumed 75W and the efficacy was a remarkable 40 lm/W, the same as a 400W MA lamp. Its luminous flux was 300 dekalumens, the mercury pressure 20 atmospheres, the arc length 18mm and tube diameter 4mm. Its had a relatively high arc voltage of 230V (lamp current 0.4A) so the lamps had to be operated from transformers with an open circuit voltage of 410V. Total system efficacy was 33 lm/W.",
						"Although the internal auxiliary striking electrode had been introduced by GEC for its MA lamps three years earlier, it was not included in the first MB lamp shown above.&nbsp; It was already pushing the quartz to its very limits to get it to accept a single tungsten wire for the main electrode, and to seal two wires through side by side was absolutely out of the question.&nbsp; A few turns of nickel wire were therefore looped around one end of the arc tube, and connected to the electrode at the opposite end.&nbsp; Part of the reason for designing a lamp with such a high voltage was that the 410V open circuit voltage of the transformer was required to make this external electrode work to reliably strike the discharge.&nbsp; For a lamp designed to work at ordinary mains voltages and frequencies, the external auxiliary electrode technique is not always reliable. (An interesting exception exists in the case of the small 40W MBM mercury lamp found in British coal mines, the first ever discharge lamp to be driven on a high frequency power supply, featured here).",
						"Not only had Philips been successful in giving the world a low wattage and efficient mercury vapour lamp, the lamp was found to offer considerably better colour rendering properties than could be attained with MA lamps.  This is because the MB types operate at much higher pressure, and colour rendering always improves with increasing mercury pressure.  A very small amount of continuum radiation was found in the spectrum of this 20 atmosphere lamp, and its red ratio increased from the 1% level of the MA lamp to about 2.5%, with no loss in efficacy.  The spectral power distribution of the MB lamp is shown in Figure 38."

						"Once the first Philora HP300 lamp was beginning to sell in quantity, two principal features of its design were found to be unfavourable and required modifying.  First, the high arc voltage necessitated a special transformer ballast which was heavy, expensive and inefficient, and it was a severe obstacle to the marketing of the lamp.  Secondly, the arc tube was so small that it blackened rather quickly and the useful lamp life was short.  The pressure was on to create a new lamp which solved these two issues.\n\t\tIn the same way that all lampmakers of any significance had started making MA lamps within a few years of its invention by GEC, the same applied after Philips created the quartz MB lamp.  Philips, British Siemens and British Thomson-Houston in particular were three companies that devoted particular attention to solving the problems.\n\t\tTo get around the blackening issue it was decided to increase the arc tube diameter and make it longer, thus increasing its internal surface area.  To meet the requirements of a lamp which would work on an open circuit voltage of 220-240V, the arc voltage necessarily had to drop to around 120V.  This happened naturally as a result of the increased arc tube dimensions.",
						"There then arose the problem of how to strike the discharge on such a low open circuit voltage.  The practical solution was to return to a third auxiliary electrode located within the arc tube.  With skill it was found that another graded seal to a third tungsten wire could be added to the side of the arc tube, rather than running all of the sealing wires through the ends of the arc tube as had been  standard practice until this time.  Such a seal is displayed in Figure 39 to the right, and an example of a lamp made with this kind of seal can be seen by clicking here.",
						"A tremendous contribution to the future of the lamp industry was made in the early 1930's by Dr. Dennis Gabor OBE, the famed Hungarian inventor who is perhaps most famous as the father of holography, for which he won the Nobel Prize in 1971.",
						"In 1931 he took up employment in the Berlin labs of Siemens &amp; Halske (the predecessor of the present-day German Osram company, no connection with Osram-GEC of England).  While there he was charged with developing a high pressure cadmium lamp, which it was felt could be a viable alternative to mercury.  He realised that quartz had to be used as the arc tube material because cadmium tends to be quite corrosive towards other glasses, and devoted much of his attention to sealing metallic conductors through quartz.  In 1931 he was awarded a German patent for a method based on very thin, flat conductors of molybdenum.  These molybdenum strips were so thin that despite having a coefficient of expansion some 8 times greater than quartz, the foil was thin enough that the small amount it expanded by was not sufficient to rupture the seal.  Osram employed these seals in the manufacture of UV lamps for laboratory and medical applications and for many years they were unknown to other lighting firms who were struggling on a similar topic.  German Osram had little activity in mercury discharges for lighting applications at that time and surprisingly failed to realise the significance of Gabor's seal.",
						"With the rise of Hitler in 1933, Gabor left Germany and obtained employment as an inventor in the research laboratories of the British Thomson-Houston company in Rugby, England.  He was a great asset to the discharge lamp development team, where he introduced the company to his molybdenum foil seals and went on to develop many other ideas for BTH - one of the most famous being a ballastless discharge lamp.  Shortly after Philips put its first HP300 lamp on the market, BTH showed a very similar product but which was made with Gabor's molybdenum foil seals.  The reliability of the seal was improved by sharpening the sides of the foil to knife-edges by an electropolishing method, giving it an almost ragged appearance along the edges.  This eliminated the seal leaks that otherwise  occur if the edge of the foil is perfectly straight or not feathered, as a tiny airline would often be formed along these edges. With the moly foil seal it became easy to accommodate a third wire for the auxiliary striking electrode, and Gabor's arc tube, first marketed through BTH Mazda, set the standard for all quartz arc tubes right up to the early 1950's.  An arc tube made with molybdenum foil seals is shown below in Figure 41.",
						"A slight improvement on this seal was perfected by British Siemens, who recognised that a serious bottleneck in the lampmaking process was the handling of these thin foils and the welding of an electrode to one side, and a molybdenum lead wire to the other side.  The welding process may justifiably be described as completely out of control in the early days; getting tungsten to stick to molybdenum when spot-welded is quite an art!  The technique employed by Siemens was to take a molybdenum wire and press it flat in the centre.  That flattened region was then rolled to a very fine strip, and its edges sharpened as usual.  The component thus formed was a single piece consisting of the foil with a wire on either side, to which an electrode could be attached and external connections made.  The Siemens seal is shown in Figure 42. It was only short-lived though, because before long the welding problems were overcome by using intermediate so-called 'referee' metals which helped the parts stick together more strongly, as well as through improved control of the welding current.  Various methods were used and indeed still are used today.  The foil is often platinised on the side to be welded, or a small amount of platinum enamel may be applied before welding, or as an alternative a thin wire or strip of tantalum may be sandwiched between the parts to be welded.  The waveform of the current supplied to the welding electrodes is also of great importance in making a good quality joint.",
						"The most recent update to the method of forming a mercury arc tube was to mechanise the process of sealing the electrodes into the arc tube through a remarkably simple process innovation.  Instead of using atmospheric pressure to collapse the quartz down over the foil, a technique was developed which allowed the lampmaker to pinch the quartz flat around the foils on a fully automatic machine.  Oxidation of the molybdenum and electrodes was prevented by flushing argon through the tube to be sealed continuously during the heating process.\n\t\tTo ensure that the correct shape was formed around the electrodes at the ends of the arc tube, the tube diameter was first reduced at each end.  This was usually carried out by one of three methods.  The first was to manually stretch the end regions down to a smaller diameter while heating the tube, this method requiring skilled glassblowers and being rather time-consuming (Figure 43a).  Another method was to attach short lengths of narrow bore tubing to each end of the arc tube (Figure 43b).  Alternatively the tube was simply rilled-in at the region around the electrodes to form the correct shape here, and below this point the tube remained at its full diameter (Figure 43c).\n\t\tThe electrode mount assemblies were then located inside the vertically mounted arc tube on a special machine, a flow of argon was flushed into the assembly through the exhaust tube, and oxy-hydrogen fires rapidly brought the end of the tube up to its softening temperature over a period of about ten seconds.  Oscillating fires were normally employed to spread the heat out well over the entire surface of the area to be pinched.  Then in a split second heating would cease and a pair of brass hammers would fly in from either side and pinch the quartz flat around the foils.  The process was then repeated at the opposite end of the arc tube.",
						"The process of pre-shaping the arc tube ends prior to pinch sealing was rather tedious and something that lampmakers were keen to abandon in efforts to further speed the production.  In 1960 it was successfully abolished by incorporating a V-shape region into the top of the hammers used to make the quartz pinch-seal.  By heating a greater length of quartz at the end of the tube it could be partially pushed inwards as part of the pinching action, thereby forming a very neat conical end chamber around the electrodes.  This was the last process improvement made in the fabrication of MB style arc tubes, and since then the production method has remained largely unchanged.  To speed up the process alternative methods of heating have been introduced though.  The oxy-hydrogen fires are quite slow to heat up the quartz, and recent methods involve ionising the argon gas which is flushed over the electrodes to form a plasma torch, rather similar to the flame found in an atomic absorption spectrometer.  This method is much faster and cheaper to operate than traditional fires, but a large capital expenditure is required to construct the machinery."
