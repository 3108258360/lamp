						"Since its commercial introduction in 1932, the Low Pressure Sodium lamp has consistently maintained its enviable position as the most efficient light source available. In recent years, increasing competition from other discharge lamps is resulting in a slow decline in its market, but it continues to be specified for new installations, particularly in Belgium, the Netherlands, and other global regions in the vicinity of important astronomical observation sites in view of the greatly reduced light pollution it causes.  The construction of a typical LPS lamp is illustrated in Figure S1.",
						"For reasons of optimal efficacy the sodium vapour is kept at low pressure, which calls for a discharge tube of large dimensions having a relatively low operating temperature.  This permits the use of ordinary glass types such as soda-lime silicate or borosilicate, however a protective layer of special borate glass is blown onto the inner surface of the glass tube so as to reduce the rate of attack by the chemically corrosive sodium vapour. To reduce the length of the long discharge tube it is customary to fold it into a U-shape, although linear designs also exist.  The discharge tube is dosed with metallic sodium and also contains a rare gas filling, usually neon-based, which facilitates starting.  The electric current is supplied via thermionic electrodes at either end, which are similar in construction to those of the low pressure mercury fluorescent lamp, but of somewhat heavier construction on account of the higher lamp currents.  The discharge tube requires thermal insulation to ensure a high lamp efficacy, and this is provided by mounting it inside a secondary outer bulb.  It is evacuated to minimise thermal conduction and convection losses, and in the more modern lamps is coated on its inner surface with an infra-red reflective film to minimise radiated heat loss.  The outer bulb is equipped with either a bayonet or pin-type cap to ensure the correct alignment of the discharge tube in the optical system of the luminaire.",
						"The reason for the remarkably high efficacy of the low pressure sodium discharge is not so much because its discharge converts electrical energy into visible light particularly efficiently, moreover it is due to the fact that the wavelength of light it radiates happens to be very close to the peak sensitivity of the human eye under normal viewing conditions.  Figure S2 shows the energy balance of a typical low pressure sodium lamp, which reveals that in fact only about 30% of the input power is converted into visible light.  This percentage is comparable with other modern discharge lamps.  Figure S3 meanwhile illustrates its spectrum superimposed on the sensitivity curve of the human eye, which shows the proximity of its radiation to the most effective wavelengths.",
						"The lamp has been subjected to continual improvements in materials and manufacturing technology over the years, which has allowed it to unfailingly maintain its position as the most efficient light source available. Figure S4 illustrates the elevating efficacy of each of the principal light source technologies over time, and there is no technical reason why low pressure sodium should stop here. Whether or not manufacturers find it commercially interesting to make the necessary investments in further improvements is another matter however!  That fact alone is responsible for the flattening of the LPS line since the 1990s, when all further research on this technology effectively ceased.\n\t\tIt is interesting to note from this chart that since the inception of each light source technology, it generally maintains its relative position in the league of efficacies at all times - rarely overtaking or falling behind a competitive light source. The sole exception to this is the semiconductor light emitting diode, which has only witnessed serious development in very recent times. There is no doubt that this unique light source will overtake many of its competitors in its efficacy, however it remains to be seen whether or not LED's can be developed in other areas, particularly luminous flux and cost, which would see them begin to threaten other light sources. The prime position which Low Pressure Sodium holds at the top of this chart is expected to be maintained for many years into the future.",
						"Low Pressure Sodium light has a number of very unique properties arising from its spectral output, many of which make it technically the most suitable light source for road lighting and these are covered in detail on the next page. In addition, the large physical size of the lamp means that it has a low surface luminance so it is less likely to give rise to glare, and the low operating temperature permits the use of compact optical systems and lightweight plastic lanterns. They are the favoured light sources for tunnel illumination, particularly in Japan and Korea where underground roads extending 10 miles or more are not unusual. The long lamps may be aligned end-to-end to produce a continuous line of light and this almost totally eliminates the stroboscopic effect of driving past high brightness lights at speed. Driver fatigue is drastically reduced there is a well proven link between low pressure sodium lighting and reduced accident rates in tunnels. Fluorescent lamps also lend themselves well to this application, but SOX offers a more energy efficient solution.\n\t\tFurthermore, the lamp itself is relatively inexpensive and can be operated on low cost electrical control gear. Of increasing significance is the fact that it contains zero mercury, and can be easily disposed of as non-toxic waste without incurring extra expense at its end of life. Most high pressure sodium and all other light sources employed in street lighting contain mercury and special restrictions apply to the disposal of used lamps. A final advantage is that in the case of a momentary power supply interruption, the lamp will restrike as soon as the power is restored and no cooling down period is required.\n\t\tThe burning position is generally confined to the horizontal position ±20°. Greater inclinations can result in the liquid sodium running down to the lower end of the lamp with the result that the upper part of the lamp becomes depleted of sodium vapour and efficacy is lost. Vertical burning is permitted only for the low wattage lamps, but only with the cap uppermost. Illumination with the cap down would cause an accumulation of sodium behind the electrodes, and the glass-to-metal seals in this region are a weak point which can fail in the presence of excess sodium.",
						"No light source offers a full set of advantages, and the SOX lamp is certainly no different.  One of its principal weaknesses is that no colour rendering is possible under its monochromatic light.  Althogh that is not necessarily a limitation in outdoor lighting, and can even be beneficial in street lighting, its principal weakness is that its rated life is shorter than other types of discharge lamps. Typical installations have to be re-lamped every two years whereas the expensive maintenance schedule can be extended to three or four years with high pressure sodium, and the reduced maintenance cost of the latter can totally offset the cost of energy savings with low pressure sodium.\n\t\tThe long life SOX-Plus lamp was introduced in 1994 to counteract this change, but has only been partially successful because the lamp was essentially unchanged, it simply had a longer guarantee period. The SOX-PSG lamp introduced in 2003 is a much more satisfactory solution in which premature failures before 6000 hours, i.e. the first 18 months of normal streetlighting service, have been completely eliminated. A three year maintenance cycle is perfectly feasible with this lamp which attains a survival rate of 92% after 12,000 burning hours.  Even though there may be room in low pressure sodium technology to extend its lifetime further, manufacturers can earn greater revenues with more modern light source technologies and for commercial reasons it is no longer interesting to invest effort in the further improvement of the low pressure sodium lamp.",
						"The monochromatic output of the low pressure sodium lamp precludes its use from all indoor general lighting applications, and all outdoor applications where colour rendering is required.  This confines its use almost exclusively to the lighting of major trunk roads, where the high luminous efficacy often makes it the most economical light source - so long as maintenance costs are not so high that the longer-lived high pressure sodium becomes a more viable alternative.  Security perimeter lighting around buildings is another important application, in which the monochromatic radiation is outstanding for allowing enhanced visiual detection of movement, changes in contrast etc.  Owing to the fact that its radiation is monochromatic, it can easily be filtered out with a single wavelength filter plate, and this makes LPS the favoured source to reduce light pollution in the vicinity of astronomical observation sites.  By placing a narrow bandwidth filter over the analysis equipment, the sodium radiation can be removed from the sky-glow while allowing all other wavelengths to pass.  Perhaps their only important indoor application is in the general illumination of photographic laboratories producting black-and-white prints.  The monochromatic yellow radiation is at a wavelength which will not cause the photographic papers to fog, and permits high illumination levels in the working environment."

						"It has already been mentioned that sodium lamps emit their light very near to the peak sensitivity of the human eye under normal viewing conditions, this fact accounting for their remarkably high luminous efficacy. The light emitted is monochromatic, i.e. it is comprised of only one colour. Incandescent lamps produce light of all colours over the entire visible range 400 to 700 nanometres (nm), so these have good colour rendering properties. Other light sources produce light at many different discrete wavelengths and all provide some degree of colour rendering. However, low pressure sodium light is almost totally made up from deep yellow wavelengths at 589.0 and 589.6nm, and no colour rendering is possible. While this does not cause a problem on major roads it may be unacceptable in other areas such as town centres, and it totally precludes the use of this light source for interior lighting or in any other application where colour rendering is required. The spectral power distribution of the low pressure sodium lamp is compared with several other common light sources, as well as Daylight, in Figure S5.",
						"Traditionally, it has been proposed that low pressure sodium light is the safest to drive under. This is due to its monochromatic output which improves the perception of contrast and allows the light to penetrate fog and rain with the minimum of dispersion. Moisture in the atmosphere acts as a kind of prism, and will split light up into its component colours, a phenomenon which is seen naturally whenever the conditions are such that a rainbow becomes visible in the sky. SOX light contains only one colour and cannot be dispersed into blurred multicolour images that other light sources deliver, illustrated in Figure S6, thus the images received by the human eye are always sharp and clear.",
						"The light contains no blue radiation, a colour which is easily scattered in the atmosphere and to a very great extent in fog and mist - indeed, the sky appears blue because this wavelength of light is scattered around in the upper atmosphere, and is less able to penetrate it.  Blue light also has an adverse effect on the pupil, in that relatively small amounts of this wavelength cause it to contract and not as much light is then able to enter the eye. Visibility can sometimes be enhanced simply by removing blue wavelengths of light such that the pupil opens wider and allows more light into the eye. Because low pressure sodium does not contain any blue radiation, the eye is able to see very clearly under this light.\n\t\tIn addition, we can perceive the contrasts between moving and stationary objects more quickly under monochromatic light and this is of paramount importance in night-time driving. Figure S7 shows the appearance of a piece of black cloth and white paper illuminated half with a low pressure sodium (SOX) lamp and half with high pressure sodium (SON) type. The black appears much blacker when lit with SOX light, succinctly demonstrating how contrasts are enhanced with this light source. It is for this reason that warning signs, road side chevrons etc. are often printed in deep yellow and black, and even in nature many insects adopt this colour combination because it stands out better than any other",
						"The large physical size of low pressure sodium sources can make the light more difficult to control efficiently, and upward sky glare is sometimes more of a problem. Despite this, astronomers are actually fully in favour of sky glow originating from this light source. Because the light is monochromatic, it can be filtered out by removing its single wavelength and a dark sky is then restored. No other light source offers such easy filtering of night time glow in the sky. Several cities which are home to major astronomical sites have almost completely converted their night-time illumination to low pressure sodium for this reason.\n\t\tHowever, recent studies show that at the low light levels often employed in street lighting, the human eye does not function fully in the photopic state, and its colour sensitivity shifts to the scotopic (night vision) conditions. Thus the curve shown in Figure S3 may not always be valid, because its peak is shifted towards the blue end of the spectrum, as illustrated by the dashed line in Figure S8. This phenomenon is known as the Purkinje shift. Herein lies a deficiency of our measure of light - the lumen - because it is based on the normal daylight sensitivity curve of the eye.  At very low light levels, one really ought to instead rate lamps in terms of their scotopic luminous flux, instead of the universally published photopic luminous flux.  Due to the Purkinje shift, low pressure sodium lighting becomes less and less efficient at low illuminance levels. Extensive studies in USA, a country where streelighting levels are considerably lower than in other parts of the world, have clearly demonstrated that light sources having a greater proportion of green-blue light in their spectra are in fact more efficient under these circumstances.  Roads in other parts of the world, however, are lighted to much higher standards such that the effect of the Purkinje shift are much less significant.",
						"No recent work has been conducted on whether or not the advantages of reducing scattering and penetrating rain/fog, improving contrast or making moving objects stand out more clearly is outweighed by the poor scotopic performance. As a result, SOX lamps continue to go into many new installations and this is expected to carry on until more evidence is gathered - which may either kill off the SOX market totally or further reinforce its apparent strengths!"

					description: [
						"Early experiments showed that for long positive column discharge lamps, maximum lamp efficacy occurs when the sodium vapour pressure is 0.4 Pascals. This occurs above molten sodium at 260°C, and is illustrated in Figure S9. Even a slight deviation from this temperature will cause a drastic decrease in light output, so it is clear that accurate temperature control of the discharge tube is vital to maintain high efficacy.\n\t\tIt is important to realise that the sodium vapour pressure is determined only by the temperature of the coldest spot in the discharge tube.  Local hot spots have no effect in increasing the sodium vapour pressure, because the metal will preferentially evaporate from those hotter regions and condense at the coldest spot.  In other words, the sodium migrates over time to the coldest part of the lamp, and it is the temperature at this region that determines the vapour pressure and which must be kept as close as possible to 260°C.\n\t\tBecause some energy is required to heat the discharge tube to this temperature, the most efficient lamp will be the one that achieves this temperature for the lowest energy input. As will be seen later, many techniques have been combined to produce a lamp having excellent thermal insulation which heats itself to the required temperature with the lowest electrical energy input."

					subhead: "Discharge Current Density",

					description: [
						"The lamp is at its most efficient when run at low current density, i.e. low wattage per unit volume and length of the discharge tube. This necessitates a long discharge tube of large diameter.  There are limits to how large the discharge tube can be proportioned because of a troublesome phenomenon that sodium vapour is opaque to its own resonance radiation. Thus if the tube diameter was too large, light created at the core would never reach the surface.  This would offset the beneficial effects of reduced current density by the negative aspects of increased self-absorption.  For practical puproses it is necessary to make a compromise between current density and light absorption.  There is an optimum discharge tube diameter for each rating of lamp, but for practical manufacturing two different diameters have been standardised upon for the modern lamps - a small diameter for lamps having a discharge current of 0.6A, and a larger diameter for the 0.9A types.",
						"Fortunately the self-absorption effect is not so catastrophic as it might sound, due to a second beneficial process that occurs in low pressure discharge lamps. During operation, the inner wall of the discharge tube acquires a small negative electrical charge due to accumulation of free electrons at its surface.  To offset this charge imbalance, the positive sodium ions are also drawn towards the wall.  The process is called ionic pumping and is clearly illustrated in Figure S10 which shows part of an SO/H discharge tube during the early phases of run-up.",
						"At this stage when the total quantity of sodium ionisation is low and the discharge is still predominately taking place in the rare gas filling, it is plain to see that the sodium ionisation is taking place mainly at the inner surface of the glass tube - irrespective of whether or not there happens to be a sodium droplet in the vicinity.  When the lamp has fully run up, the result is that much of the light is not generated in the core of the discharge but instead close to the surface of the glass.  As a result it has to travel through a relatively short length of sodium vapour and there is not so much self-absorption as would be the case if the ionic pumping phenomenon did not exist.  In conclusion the effects of self-absorption are still very important, but thankfully they are minimised due to the benefits of ionic pumping.  Certain linear lamp types employed specially dimensioned discharge tubes in order to further reduce losses due to self-absorption.",
						"The earliest positive column sodium lamps of the SO/H family had relatively poor thermal insulation, and a very small diameter tube was required just to get the glass up to the required 260°C wall temperature.  This limited lamp efficacy because of the resulting high current density in the discharge tube, but it was a necessary sacrifice to achieve the correct sodium vapour pressure.\n\t\tLater developments in sodium lamps have focussed heavily on improving the luminous efficacy, and this has been accomplished principally by improving the thermal insulation.  The efficacy increases that have resulted are not so much due to the fact that the superior insulation results in less power loss, moreover these improvements have facilitated the discharge tube diameter to be increased while maintaining the critical 260°C wall temperature.  The greater diameter discharge tube is the key factor that resulted in improved lamp efficacy, thanks to the fact that the electrical current density could then be reduced.\n\t\tThis is evidenced by the earliest SOI/H lamps, having Integral vacuum jackets sealed directly around the disharge tube.  In the original Philips lamps lamps, the discharge tube maintained substantially the same proportions as the SO/H predecessors, and the lamp showed almost no efficacy improvement.  An example of such a lamp can be seen here.  The integral outer jacket was offered only because of the improved mechanical design of the lamp.  Meanwhile in the developments of Osram-GEC, the discharge tube diameter was increased in parallel with the transition to the integral outer jacket thanks to the provision of a pair of thermally insulating glass sleeves.  A typical example is shown here.  The GEC integral lamps offered considerably greater luminous efficacy than the Philips integral lamps.  Naturally at a later date, Philips followed suit and implemented a similar improvement in its thermal insulation to permit an increase of the discharge tube diameter.\n\t\tWith the Osram-GEC SOI/H development of 1955, the tube diameter had been increased to the point where any further gain would have begun to reduce efficacy due to self-absorption of the light. Some very innovative work was then commenced by BTH Mazda, who created a range of linear sodium lamps having discharge tubes of non-circular cross-section. These were much larger diameter tubes delivering low current density for optimum efficacy, but their special shaped sections ensured that the glass was closer to the discharge enabling the light to be transmitted more efficiently. These unique light sources are described fully under the Linear Sodium category."

					description: [
						"At room temperature, sodium is solid and there is insufficient vapour present for the lamp to be started at a practical voltage. Filling the discharge tube with a rare gas appreciably lowers this starting voltage - and in case a mixture of two or more rare gases is employed, the striking voltage can be reduced further.  For many rare gas mixtures, there is a particular ratio where the electrical ionisation potential of the mixture is lower than that of either of the individual gases.  Such compositions are known as Penning mixtures, named after the Dutch Philips engineer who made this discovery. Figure S11 reveals how the striking voltage of a 180W SOX lamp varies with the percentage of argon in the neon fill gas.",
						"The diagram reveals that for the lowest striking voltage, lamps should be made with around 0.25% argon in neon. Unfortunately, in practice it is not possible to work in this range because the special borate glass used for the discharge tube has a certain affinity for argon gas.  During lamp life it adsorbs or 'cleans up' a certain amount of argon. This must be compensated for by filling the lamps with a small excess of argon, to ensure that striking voltages are maintained sufficiently low during the entire lamp life.  It is customary to fill most lamps with 1% argon, and 1.5% for the 18W and 10W versions, where ignition is rather more critical because they are designed for operation on ordinary choke-type ballasts without any ignition aid.\n\t\tIncidentally, a knowledge of this argon clean-up phenomenon is important when attempting to light very old sodium lamps that have not been used for many years.  During the period when the lamp is warming up, the rate of argon clean-up is relatively fast because it is during this period that the gas filling is being most heavily ionised.  High velocity argon ions impinge the glass wall with greater force and the chance of their adsorption is rather high.  If such a lamp is switched off soon after its first ignition, there is a horrible possibility that sufficient argon will have been adsorbed that the lamp's striking voltage becomes so high that it can never be started again.  However the glass will liberate the majority of the adsorbed argon over a period of several hours if maintained at its typical high operating temperature.  This phenomenon only affects older generations of lamps made before the mid 1960s when different glass compositions were used.  Furthermore, lamps which have been in storage for a very long period of time are particularly prone to show accelerated argon adsorption the first time they are switched on.  It is therefore advisable when lighting such lamps to allow them to run up to full operating temperature for several hours, before switching off.  Once the glass has been conditioned by this treatment, the lamp will be safe to use again with shorter switching cycles on future occasions provided it is not left without lighting for many years again.",
						"Lamp efficacy is optimum when a buffer gas having a low molecular weight is employed. Helium is the lowest molecular weight gas that is compatible with such a lamp, however it cannot be used because it diffuses out through the glass relatively quickly. Neon is the next best choice, but it must be combined with a small amount of the heavier argon to achieve the aforementioned Penning mixture and enable the discharge to ignite at a suitably low voltage.\n\t\tEfficacy is also best when the gas filling pressure is low. This is because the fewer atoms of rare gas that are in the tube, the less likely it is that light-generating sodium ions will knock into these and lose their energy in an atomic collision. Such kind of energy losses create heat and result in lower lamp efficacy. The lowest possible pressure of neon-argon filling might at once seem the most desirable choice - but as always in lamp technology, it is not quite so simple because gas pressure has a strong impact on life.",
						"The electrical current is supplied to the discharge tube via a pair electrodes, coated with a trimetallic oxide mixture of electron-emissive materials.  This emitter coating enables the current to be injected into the discharge space with the minimum energy loss, again to yield good lamp efficacy. The electrodes necessarily run hot so as to achieve enhanced thermionic emission, and during life the emitter coating is gradually consumed by evaporation and sputtering effects. After it has gone, the lamp will begin to rectify, drawing large currents that will either cause failure of the built-in fuses inside the cap, or destruction of the electrode assembly in case no fuses are fitted.\t\t\n\t\tIt is fairly simple to prolong lamp life by slowing the rate of emitter loss from the electrodes simply by increasing the pressure of the rare gas filling.  The increased concentration of gas atoms in the vicinity of the electrodes helps to prevent atoms of emitter material from leaving the electrode surface.  Gases having a high molecular weight are the most effective for this task.  Converseley as explained in the previous section, for reasons of high lamp efficacy it is more desirable to employ a fill gas having a low molecular weight.\n\t\tSo in practice we remain confined to the low molecular weight gases, and must consider increases in their fill pressure as a mechanism of extending lamp life.  This however is also counter-productive to the achievement of a high lamp efficacy, because the increased concentration of rare gas atoms in the discharge space also leads to more frequent elastic and inelastic collisions with sodium ions.  These collisions take away their energy that would otherwise have been available for conversion into light.  A compromise must therefore be reached between efficacy and lifetime.  Bearing in mind the fact that other failure mechanisms are different for the high wattage and low wattage lamp types, which result in differing lives for the two variants, different filling pressures have been established as 4-8 torr for the high wattage lamps, and 8-12 torr for the low watts range.",
						"In the late 1970s a novel Neon-Argon-Xenon mixture was introduced by Thorn Lighting in its Linear Sodium range. Xenon, being a heavier atom, naturally retards the evaporation rate of the electrodes and their emitter coating.  This allowed gas fill pressures to be reduced slightly for a given lamp life - and as explained earlier, reduced pressure is desirable for increasing lamp efficacy.  However it is necessary to keep the concentration of xenon as low as possible to avoid it becoming involved in a collision with a sodium ion, leading to some energy loss in the discharge.",
						"In practice it was found that there exists an optimum concentration of 99% Neon, 0.8% Argon, 0.2% Xenon which allows a small reduction in fill pressure and delivers a small but still significant improvement in both lamp efficacy and lifetime.  It was employed by Thorn in the 140W and 200W High Output Linear Sodium lamps only, where the performance boost it delivered was slightly more significant than in the circular cross-section discharge tubes employed in the normal SOX range.  The difference in the characteristic rare-gas discharge colour before the lamp has run up is depicted in Figure S12."

						"At the operating temperature of the lamp sodium is chemically very active. Ordinary glasses, even quartz, are rapidly stained brown which blocks out light. The stained areas also have a different coefficient of expansion from the unstained material, and differences in expansion may then cause the glass to crack. In 1920, a special sodium resistant glass - borate glass - was developed by Arthur H. Compton. However, pure borate glass is unsatisfactory in lamp manufacture. It is known as a 'short glass', meaning that it has a short working temperature range. On heating, the glass changes from the rigid condition to fluidity very quickly, thus making it rather difficult to process. The earliest sodium lamps could only be manufactured with the assistance of the most skilled master glassblowers who were adept at handling this glass.",
						"The problem was overcome by using a 2-ply glass tube. A very thin layer (about 0.02mm) of barium aluminoborate glass is blown onto the inside of an ordinary soda-lime tube. The soda glass can be worked relatively easily on automatic equipment, and acts as a support for the borate lining which is so thin as to be almost insignificant. This allows the sodium-resistant ply tubing to be formed using standard glassworking methods.  Figure S13 shows the general arrangement.",
						"The coefficients of thermal expansion of the borate and soda-lime glasses are not perfectly matched, and this can cause problems of cracking through the introduction of permanent thermal stresses. It is necessary to provide longer annealing schedules for ply tubing than for other glass types. In addition, it is important to maintain uniformity of the borate coating thickness around the tube circumference, so that radial stress differences are minimised. The most critical operation is bending the tube. During this process the glass wall thickness naturally decreases on the outside of the bend, and increases on the inside. This effect must be minimised by correct location of the melt in the U-shaped mould and by adjustment of the glass wall thickness before moulding.\t\n\t\tIf there is any unevenness in the thickness of the borate layer, sodium corrosion will be more of a problem in the thin areas. This will cause early lamp failure by excessive light absorption arising from stained glass, or cracking. Even if the glass is made well, good lampmaking practice is also required because the borate coating can be easily damaged. This glass type is highly sensitive to moisture and is readily attacked by the same. For this reason, borate glass is generally delivered to a lamp factory in heated trucks, and stored in a heated room to prevent moisture condensing in the glass. The temperature must also be kept constant, since it can otherwise result in expansion and contraction of the air inside the tubes, with a risk that moist air may be drawn in during cooling.",
						"A major drawback of borate glasses is the fact that they tend to clean up argon, a gas which is essential for easy lamp starting and long life. Many decades of development have produced a modern glass which has good sodium resistance and a relatively low argon cleanup rate. Although the glass is not yet perfect, it has been improved to the state that the rate of argon cleanup is no longer a life-limiting mechanism.  Further information on argon clean-up can be found on the previous page.",
						"The wetting and adhesion of liquid sodium to borate glasses is another matter of considerable importance to the sodium lamp engineer.  This was not a great problem until 1955 when a new glass type was developed by Philips that showed a considerable improvement in its resistance to sodium.  The new glass did not stain so rapidly over lamp life, and delivered a significant boost in lumen maintenance and lamp lifeteime.  One significant drawback however, was the fact that liquid sodium did not adhere so well to its surface.  If the lamps were not operated perfectly level, the sodium would tend to run down to one end of the lamp forming large light-blocking mirrors, and leaving the other end depleted.  The problem was partly overcome with the introduction of the so-called Bamboo lamp, whose discharge tube is rilled-in at frequent points along its length.  These constructions were sufficient to limit the movement of sodium around the discharge tube.  A typical Bamboo lamp can be seen here.  It was a relatively short-lived lamp that was manufactured only by Philips, and was superseded by 1958 once improved glass types had been developed that showed good chemical resistance to sodium while also causing better adhesion of the liquid metal."

						"The electrode construction of the low pressure sodium lamp is similar to that of the low pressure mercury fluorescent lamp, although somewhat heavier to handle the higher discharge currents. The electrode is a beehive shaped triple coil of black tungsten wire, which acts as a hollow cathode so as to reduce the lamp striking voltage.  It is coated with a layer of emissive materials which improves its thermionic efficiency.  The method of sealing into the discharge tube is quite unique - a special design is required on account of the aggressive behaviour of hot sodium vapour towards the glass-to-metal seals which present a weak spot in the lamp construction.  The arrangement of a typical low pressure sodium electrode assembly is illustrated in Figure S14.",
						"To reduce the energy losses associated with injecting a flow of electrons into the discharge space, and thereby reduce the temperatures and thermal losses in the vicinity of the electrodes, they are coated with a selection of electron-emissive substances.  The emitter is most commonly of the triple carbonate type, and consists of a mixture of barium, strontium and calcium carbonates suspended in an organic solvent. The tungsten coils are dipped into the suspension and an electrophoretic process draws a precise amount of emitter into the spaces between the coils.\n\t\tThe emitter must be thermally activated before the lamp is sealed, and this is effected by electrically heating the cathodes under vacuum. The carbonates decompose and are reduced to the metal oxides, evolving carbon dioxide gas in the process.",
						"It is important not to pump the evolved gases away immediately and to continue activation a little while longer. Some of the carbon dioxide then reacts with tungsten metal in the cathode to form tungstic oxide, and this in turn reacts with the metal oxides to produce the metal tungstates which forms a more durable emitter.",
						"Once activated, the carbonaceous gases must be pumped away as their presence in a finished lamp would lead to short lifetime, low efficacy, and high striking voltages.  The discharge tubes are then filled with pure neon and a discharge is struck while still on the exhaust machine, using special ballasts that provide a higher than normal open circuit voltage. This cleans the glass and electrode assemblies by ion bombardment, causing further impurities to be released.  These are then pumped away, and before its removal from the exhaust machine each discharge tube receives its dose of liquid sodium, plus the final fill gas.  Once activated the cathodes must not be exposed to air or moisture because this will poison them, and could result in premature lamp failure.\n\t\t During lamp operation, particularly when starting, some emitter is thrown off the cathodes. When there is no emitter left, the lamp will not strike so easily, and this marks the end of lamp life. Alternatively, if one electrode loses its emitter before the other, the lamp could rectify (it converts the alternating current supply to direct current). During rectification large DC currents flow which can damage the ballast's windings. It is for this reason that one of the outer lead wires in each lamp is thinner, designed to fuse if the lamp rectifies, and thus saving the ballast.\n\t\tIt is important to ensure that the correct amount of emitter is deposited on the cathodes. If there is not enough then it will be consumed too rapidly and the lamp will have a short life. If there is too much then it can flake off in large pieces and there is some evidence to suggest that this also reduces lamp life and leads to premature blackening of the tube ends. The emitter coating should be over the tungsten coil only, and must not extend down over the clamp to the nickel lead-wires, if present.",
						"The point where the metal wires of the electrode assembly are pinch-sealed into the discharge tube glass represents a weak spot in the lamp construction, and if measures are not taken to keep the sodium away from the seals, they will be attacked resulting in premature lamp failure.\n\t\tThe first level of protection is to seal a short length of sodium-resistant borate glass over each of the metallic lead wires. 2-ply glass is again used here, but unlike the glass used for the discharge tube, this time the borate layer is present on the outer surface of the tube.\n\t\tNaturally this borate coating offers good protection along the length of the glass-sleeved region, but it does not extend right over the ends of the sleeved area, where the metal wire penetrates the glass.  Sodium must be kept away from this exposed area, and it has been found particularly effective to seal a small tubular bead of magnesium oxide into the glass at this location.  This have been found to be entirely satisfactory in keeping liquid sodium from coming into contact with the glass-metal seal.  The temperature inside the ceramic bead is a little higher than the rest of the lamp during operation, and it also takes longer to cool down after switching off.  The slightly higher temperatures it maintains at this spot are effective in preventing sodium condensation here.\n\t\tSince about 1985, a slightly improved seal has been employed in Philips lamps.  It was first employed in the Belgian made SOX-E types, and about a decade later was extended to the rest of the range after all SOX production had been relocated to Britain.  In this construction, pure borate glass sleeving is employed - it is not a 2-ply glass tube.  Being composed of a single glass type, its protection is extended right over the ends of the sleeved region up to and in contact with the metal lead-wire.  The use of a magnesia bead is therefore no longer necessary.\n\t\tAn interesting further improvement of the Philips seals is the use of an iron-nickel-cobalt alloy for the lead-in wires, instead of the classic copper-sheathed nickel-iron (dumet) wires that are employed in competitor's SOX and indeed all other lamps fabricated in soft glass.  This offers a small decrease in the occurrence of seal leaks, which are a rare phenomenon that sometimes affects lamps having dumet seals.  Occasionally if the copper sheath has not been sufficiently well brazed to the nickel-iron core, tiny leakage pathways may exist.  Since the Fe-Ni-Co wire is made from a single alloy, such kind of leakage problems are entirely eliminated.\n\t\tThe two kinds of seals can be identified by the colour of the metallic wire passing through the glass.  Dumet lamps always show a copper colour appearance in low pressure sodium lamps, whereas the Fernico type seals show a green-grey colouration."

					description: [
						"As a sodium lamp ages, the initial sodium distribution is very rarely maintained. When sodium lamps are constructed with an integral vacuum outer bulb, temperature gradients are set up along the discharge tube. Power losses are greater at the tube ends near the cathodes, and so these regions of the tube are hottest. The regions behind the cathodes are cold because there is no discharge there. The U-bend end of the lamp is also cold because the thermal insulation is less effective in that area. If precautions are not taken to eliminate these cold spots, the sodium migrates from hot areas to cold.\n\t\tThe situation can be improved by grading the thickness of the IR coating along the tube length. The coating is thicker near the bend so that insulation is improved there. Graded IR coatings are employed on all lamps manufactured by Osram and Thorn/GE (Philips has a uniform coating thickness combined with a different solution).  In addition, the tube diameter at the bend is critical. As this area of the tube runs cold it is standard practice to slightly constrict around the bend. This provides a local increase in the discharge current density and increases the wall temperature.\n\t\tThe biggest problem arises if the sodium migrates behind the electrodes. This point of the glass tube is where the sodium resistance is weakest and chemical attack can occur readily. This will often cause the glass to crack and is a common cause of premature failures in sodium lamps. For this reason, sodium lamps should never be run with the cap down as this encourages sodium to migrate to the cooler areas behind the electrodes.",
						"If sodium migration is so severe that a portion of the discharge tube becomes depleted of sodium vapour, the rare gasfilling takes over the discharge at that point. Since this is more difficult to ionise, the lamp current density increases here and efficacy begins to diminish. In addition, this region produces almost no light, further reducing efficacy. If the rare gasfilling pressure is low, say 6 torr (as in high watts lamps), this part of the tube will run cooler than the rest, encouraging sodium to migrate back to that point and solving the problem. In low watts lamps, higher gasfilling pressures (at least 8 to 9 torr) are necessary and under these conditions sodium migration may not be self-correcting since the sodium-depleted discharge region may overheat, exacerbating the migration problem. The sodium may all be distilled to one end of the lamp leaving behind just the rare gas discharge at the other end. Such lamps are known as red burners and are still occasionally seen in modern streetlighting installations.\t\n\t\tA further snag occurs when a zone becomes deficient in sodium - in that the argon component of the gasfilling becomes ionised. In just the same way that the phenomenon of ionic pumping attracts sodium ions to a negatively charged sheath beside the discharge tube wall, the same is true of argon atoms that become ionised.  If they impact the wall with sufficient force they will become embedded in the glass surface. Argon cleanup by the glass changes the Penning gas mixture causing the lamp striking voltage to rise. Eventually the striking voltage will rise above that supplied by the electrical control gear, and the lamp will not start. This is the end of lamp life (Gas Failure).",
						"Some of these problems can be overcome by distributing the sodium evenly throughout the discharge tube so that it is less likely for some areas to become depleted. In addition, sodium vapour does not diffuse along the tube easily as it has to travel against the electric current. As a result, each droplet of sodium supplies vapour mostly to its immediate surroundings. It is therefore beneficial to distribute droplets of sodium around the discharge tube, so that all areas have sufficient sodium vapour and a faster run-up time is attained. It is for this reason that each lamp contains about 500,000 times more sodium than is actually required as vapour in the discharge.\n\t\tSince 1958 Philips has located the sodium in small dimples in the discharge tube side which are naturally colder, helping to maintain an even sodium distribution. A dimpled SOX lamp is shown in Figure S15. In practice some of the sodium still migrates out of these dimples after several thousand hours but they do have a number of benefits. Firstly it allows the lamp to run up about 50% more rapidly, and secondly it helps prevent wattage rise throughout life, which occurs as the sodium migrates towards the bend and depletes other areas. The former Russian manufacturer MELZ also constructed its lamps using similar dimples, but all located on one side of the U-bend whereas the Philips dimples are along the outer perimeter of the discharge tube.\tBoth Osram-GEC and Thorn have made and sold lamps having dimpled discharge tubes on and off at various times, sometimes even employing whole discharge tubes sourced in from Philips for trial purposes, but neither company felt that the dimples were successful enough to justify modifying their own production.  Indeed the graded IR coating found on Osram/GEC and Thorn/GE is on its own more than effective enough to minimise the effects of sodium migration.  Since the Philips IR coating equipment is not able to produce a graded film thickness, the dimples are far more important to the Philips lamp.  In balance, therefore, the presence of dimples is not to be seen on its own as a benefit - moreover they are only needed in case no gradation of IR coating thickness is possible.  There is some evidence to suggest, however, that particularly for older lamps the rate of run-up may be faster for the dimpled construction than for plain tubes.",
						"The only time where special geometries have been completely successful in maintaining the original sodium distribution was in the Linear Sodium lamp. Here the 'horns' of the crescent-shape discharge tube were tapered inwards so that capillary action held the molten sodium inside the narrow channels. In the Thorn discharge tubes having a clover-leaf cross section, elongated v-shaped dimples were formed at the apex of each leaf, affectionately known as 'greenhouses' because of their similarity in shape to a greenhouse roof. Because of the more uniform temperature distribution in SLI lamps the sodium tended to stay where it was originally placed.\n\t\tAnother technique, employed by Osram in the late 1950's with its SOI Integral lamps, was to form holes in the heat-reflecting sleeves at regular intervals. The idea was that more heat would be lost at these localities and the marginally cooler wall might serve to retain some sodium here. The idea was unsuccessful, but for historical interest, an example of this test lamp can be seen here."

					subhead: "Lamp Failure Mechanisms",
					description: [
						"There are four principal failure mechanisms which determine the life of a modern low pressure sodium lamp, detailed below in order of significance: End of electrode life The emissive coating becomes exhausted. End of gas life The argon content of the gas filling is consumed. Rectification May occur as a result of electrode failure. Premature failures Caused by cracking, electrolysis effects etc.",
						"This is the mechanism by which most SOX lamps reach the end of their life Quite simply, it occurs when all of the emissive coating over the surface of the electrodes has been consumed, and the voltage required by the discharge exceeds what the control gear is capable of supplying The precise time period which elapses before this condition is reached is depending primarily on the quantity of emitter which is applied to each electrode during production Clearly it is impossible to pick up precisely the same emitter weight on every electrode, and the natural variation in emitter weight leads to the variation in lamp life. Switching frequency also plays a significant role here SOX lamps are designed for one switching per 24 hours Because the load placed on the electrodes is very high during ignition, and it causes significant amounts of electrode material to be sputtered off, the more frequently it occurs the shorter will be the life of the lamp.",
						"One drawback of borate glasses, which must be used in the fabrication of SOX discharge tubes, is that they tend to have a high affinity for argon ions Most SOX lamps employ 1 to 1.5% argon in the neon gasfilling, this serving to considerably reduce the voltage required to strike the discharge to reasonable levels However all the way throughout lamp life the glass will be absorbing small amounts of the argon In some lamps, especially the high wattage types and in particular the 180W lamp, a situation can arise where the argon gasfilling will all be consumed before the electrodes reach their end of life. The problem is also more noticeable in lamps where an even sodium distribution is not maintained In the sodium depleted regions, the neon-argon gasfilling becomes ionised to a greater extent and under these conditions the rate of argon absorption is accelerated The lamp will 'fail' when the voltage required to strike the discharge exceeds the open circuit voltage of the ballast.",
						"This is a process by which the lamp begins to acts as a rectifier, converting the AC current it is fed with into a DC current A lamp might begin to do this as a result of the electron emission characteristics of one electrode changing with respect to the other Most commonly this simply results from one electrode running out of its emissive coating before the other However the same effect can occur if sodium metal comes into contact with one of the electrodes or its lead wires - this is another reason why the lead wires are glass-sleeved, to minimise the risk of contact with liquid sodium. Once rectification begins, much higher currents than normal will flow in both the lamp and the windings of the ballast In earlier designs of lamps the high current rectification could continue for many hours During this process the temperature of the ballast increases owing to the high current it passes, and this can lead to the breakdown of insulation between the windings, allowing a higher current again to flow Eventually the ballast would burn out under such high loading Modern lamps are all now equipped with a fusible monel wire inside the cap which will fail if rectification occurs, thus saving the ballast from the otherwise inevitable destruction.",
						"This is perhaps the most troublesome kind of failure because it cannot be predicted, and occurs relatively early in lamp life Generally premature failures happen as a result of manufacturing defects which have, until recently, been difficult to eliminate The precise failure mechanisms tend to be different for each manufacturer, representing the different production techniques that are employed. Electrolysis effects perhaps account for the most significant number of premature failures These occur as the result of a high electric field being set up across a glass component, which can lead to decomposition and cracking of the glass Alternatively since the sodium within the discharge tube is ionised, it can easily be drawn into the glass and crack it if a strong enough electric field is present. The formation of these electric fields can nearly all be traced back to the presence of the barium getter in the outer jacket Since this film is electrically conductive, if it comes into contact with any internal wires then an electric field will be set up between the glass substrate onto which the barium is deposited, and any wires passing through the glass Decomposition of the glass will occur leading to cracking and an air leak This can occur both for the pinch-seals of the discharge tube, and the pinch seal of the outer envelope. If the infra-red reflective coating is in contact with the barium getter, this will also become charged since it is a good electrical conductor Then if the top support of the discharge tube at the U-bend is fabricated of metal and touches the discharge tube, it can set up an electric field in the U-bend and tipoff area Sodium can be drawn into the glass here which may eventually cause cracking and discharge tube leakage. All of these effects have been eliminated in the new generation of SOX PSG lamps recently introduced by Philips Since the barium getter coating has been eliminated and replaced with a solid getter pellet, the electric fields that sometimes used to occur across some glass parts can no longer exist Consequently the vast majority of premature failures are avoided in this new lamp design, and service life is determined only by electrode and gas life The SOX PSG lamp therefore offers considerable maintenance savings, since in theory no spot-replacements should be necessary during the first 6000 hours of lamp life."

						"The origin of the sodium vapour lamp may be traced back to a 1919 patent taken out by Arthur H. Compton of Westinghouse Electric in the USA. This was the first light source which radiated the characteristic deep yellow sodium resonance lines (Compton, 1919). The mercury lamp had been in existence for nearly twenty years but sodium also made a logical material for a vapour lamp, quite simply because it has a relatively high vapour pressure. Compton had noted that the sodium discharge delivered a remarkably high luminous efficacy of more than 200lm/W, although this figure did not include the power required to heat the lamp to its operating temperature (Compton and van Voorhis, 1923).\n\t\tAt this stage it is appropriate to explain the term efficacy - it is the ratio of the total light output (lumens) to the input power (watts). The units are lumens per watt, lm/W. As a comparison, tungsten filament GLS lamps have an efficacy of about 13 lm/W. Efficiency, by contrast, refers to the absolute power in watts that is emitted as light expressed as a ratio of the wattage consumption of the lamp. Efficiency does not take account of the human eye's varying sensitivity to different colours of light as the lumen does, so efficacy is a more useful term to the lighting engineer.",
						"Efficient as Compton's lamp was, it could not be commercialised owing to the highly corrosive nature of heated sodium. No glass was available at the time which could contain the discharge without very rapid deterioration. Westinghouse therefore directed Compton's attention at creating a suitable containment, and the following year he patented a borate glass which offered considerably enhanced resistance to sodium vapour (Compton, 1920).\n\t\tIn 1920 Compton made the first successful sodium vapour lamp based on this glass, and its appearance is illustrated schematically in Figure S16. It consisted of a section of borate glass tubing which had been blown to an approximately spherical shape at the centre, and a coiled tungsten electrode was sealed into either end of the discharge vessel. The electrodes were brought to incandescent temperatures whereupon thermionic emission took place and they formed good cathodes, and a discharge could then be struck across the gap. The distance between electrodes was relatively short and the lamps therefore had a low operating voltage, and a high current was necessary to deliver a useful amount of light.",
						"It was not until 1930 that significant progress was made, when M. Pirani of the German Osram company began to experiment with sodium discharges. He created a series of low-voltage high-current tubular lamps which were operated in ovens to vaporise the sodium to the required pressure, and with a sodium vapour pressure of 10Pa in krypton-filled tubes measured discharge efficacies as great as 350lm/W (again not including the power supplied by the oven to heat the lamp). The first practical sodium light source was created following Pirani's work, and following a trial in one of the inner courtyards of the Osram buildings in Berlin, he lit one of the streets outside in August 1931. A glass sleeve around the discharge tube effected some crude thermal insulation to keep the discharge hot enough to vaporise enough of the sodium, and these lamps delivered an efficacy of some 46 lumens per watt.",
						"The first company to commence manufacture of the sodium lamp was Philips, and the earliest commercial application was made with 'Philora' lamps on the 28th June 1932. Thirty direct current lamps were installed on a section of road between Beek and Geleen in the Netherlands, and Figure S17 illustrates the type of lamp that was employed. They were driven at 15V 5.5A and attained a system efficacy of 38.5lm/W (including the transformer losses and electrode heating current). A single central cathode was mounted at the centre of a large diameter glass bulb, the cathode being coated with alkali-earth oxides for good electron emission. The discharge was struck to a pair of anode rings at opposite ends of the discharge vessel some 2cm either side of the central cathode, and the whole assembly was enclosed in a detachable dewar jacket to maintain the lamp at its high operating temperature. Lamps had to be operated in DC circuits because it was found that their life was unacceptably short when driven from an alternating current supply (Dorgelo and Bouma, 1937). This is because on DC, the sodium remained around the cathode at the centre of the bulb, whereas on AC it could migrate to the tube ends when they were in the cathode part of the cycle, and the sodium would then attack the glass at the end seals.",
						"Following on from Philips' development of the DC lamp, GE of America promptly adapted the design for AC operation and its famous 10,000 lumen 'NA-9' sodium lamp was placed on the market in 1936 (Figure S18). It had an oxide-coated heated electrode at either end of the discharge vessel (Buttolph, 1939), and was manufactured in the USA without change until 1966. Before starting, the cathodes required an excitation current of 10A at 2-3V to bring them to thermionic emission temperature, and a mechanical relay then applied the full open circuit voltage across the tube and the arc was struck in essentially pure neon. Lamps were operated in series-wired strings with the discharge current being limited to 6.6A at 50V, falling to 30V over a thirty minute period as it warmed up. The total wattage was 180W per lamp.  A smaller 145W 6,000 lumen rating operating at 5.5A called the NA-10 was also produced by GE, although that size never became popular. Additionally there was a small 65W NA-1 lamp, having a very small discharge tube and being intended as a laboratory source of monochromatic radiation.\n\t\tGE's effort was somewhat inefficient and rather short-lived (3000 hours) by contrast with simultaneous developments that were taking place in Europe, but GE still marketed this antiquated design until the company had perfected its high pressure sodium light source. It is interesting to note here that to circumvent patents relating to the borate glass that was required for sodium lamps, GE developed a different approach to protect the glass in its NA series light sources. The large discharge vessel was first fabricated from ordinary borosilicate glass, blown into a mould just like mercury arc tubes of the period, and then filled up with a solution which left a deposit on the inner surface of the bulb after draining out. Following a high temperature firing schedule, a borate-rich layer was fused to the inner surface of the bulb. This created a glass composition which had not been covered by competitors patents in view of the fact that such a glass is not workable (i.e. it cannot be heated up and shaped like other glasses).\t\n\t\tJust like the Philips design the entire discharge tube was operated inside a dewar jacket to provide thermal insulation, with a stack of soft asbestos rings around the cap closing the neck area to prevent convected heat losses.",
						"Both the Philips and GE low voltage sodium lamps were fabricated along similar lines to incandescent lamps of the period - thus a glass stem assembly was formed, in which the leading-in wires were sealed into a glass tube, one end of which had been flared out. The rim of the flare was then fused into the open neck of the glass bulb sealing both parts together to yield the arrangement shown in Figure S18a. This created a problem, because the neck area was a long distance away from the heat of the discharge and sodium would tend to condense here and never get hot enough to be vaporised into the discharge. Shortening the neck area and bringing the stem further into the bulb was of course feasible, but that resulted in the glass-to-metal seals becoming closer to the discharge and operating at a higher temperature. Rapid corrosion of even the best borate glass then occurred and the seals would crack. The problem was overcome by two different approaches - that of Figure S18b being the ultimate Philips solution, whereas GE adopted the design in Figure S18c.\n\t\tPhilips pioneered the introduction of the so-called \"reversed pinch\" in which the pinch-seal around the leading in wires was made on the outside of the bulb. Thus the glass-to metal seals were kept at a low enough temperature to ensure reliability, but sufficiently warm to prevent sodium condensation.\n\t\tGE's preferred approach, which was an earlier abandoned development of Philips, was to continue with the stem sealed design but to isolate the neck from the bulb portion. Either a chrome-iron or a mica plate separated the two regions, pierced by the lead wires which were cemented into place with a non-silicate ceramic paste. A small glass or ceramic tube also penetrated the disc, out of necessity to enable the lower volume of the lamp to be evacuated during manufacture, but the tube was so slender that virtually no sodium would pass through into the neck chamber during the lamp's relatively short life, thus keeping the aggressive filling away from the vulnerable glass to metal seals."

						"Philips very soon realised that an AC driven lamp which created light from a long, thin positive column discharge was a much more efficient efficient arrangement than the former short arc low voltage lamps, because the efficiency of a sodium lamp increases as the current density in the discharge falls. Thus a long tube was called for and as the gap between the electrodes was increased, this necessarily called for a high voltage to be applied across the lamp. The high voltage had an added advantage, in that lamps no longer had to be operated in long series chains on the mains electricity supply, and each could be connected independently of the others in an installation.\n\t\tAlternating current is absolutely essential for the high voltage lamps, because owing to the great length of the discharge tube, the sodium would all be drawn to the cathode end within a short period of time if it was operated on direct current. In the DC lamps discussed on the previous page, this was not a problem since the cathode is at the centre of a large bulb and it served to maintain the sodium at the core of the discharge.\n\t\tIn the first design, again pioneered by Philips, the long discharge tube was double-folded into four parallel sections to achieve a similar compactness to the earlier DC products, and it was operated inside a detatchable dewar jacket to maximise its efficacy. Oxide-coated electrodes were sealed into either end of the tube on a stem assembly similar to that used for incandescent lamps of the time. Four pins of the base supplied current to cathodes at each end of the tube such that they could be preheated before starting the discharge, and the heating current was maintained continuously to ensure that the electrodes were sufficently warm for effiecient operation.  The fifth central pin was connected to the discharge tube upper support, acting as en external auxiliary electrode to aid ignition.  This style of lamp was famously introduced in late 1932 on the Purley Way in Croydon, UK. It was known as the Philora 'DA' lamp, rated 100 watts at 0.6A and delivered a much improved luminous efficacy of 62lm/W.  The DA name implies a Double-folded discharge type having type A electrodes (which require an external heating current).",
						"It was soon discovered that as a result of the high voltage across the lamp, sufficient power was actually radiated at the electrodes that they kept themselves warm, and also suffiently robust that cold-starting was possible.  Later in 1932 the lamp shown above quickly evolved into a simplified construction having a large E40 screw base, one terminal being connected to each end of the discharge tube.  Of course, the elimination of the cathode heating current also made the control gear considerably smaller and simplified the wiring arrangements.  -These lamps were known as the type DO - having Double-folded discharge tube with the O electrodes (which are oxide coated and do not require external heating).  A lamp of this construction is illustrated in Figure S20.",
						"Both of these designs were short-lived, and before the year 1932 was out efficiency was again advanced when the lamp was redesigned into a plain U-shaped discharge tube operating inside the dewar jacket. Although the lamp was not so compact, it had advantages because sodium vapour absorbs its own radiation, and in the DA lamps some light was being lost due to the light from one tube being absorbed by its neighbours. Thus luminous efficacy with the new arrangement was increased a few percent and a complete range of different wattage lamps was put on the market. They were offered in ratings of 50W, 65W and 100W for operation at a current of 0.6A, and a 150W size for 0.9A operation. The name SO/H was coined at this time, and these lamps set the standard for nearly all of the future low pressure sodium developments."

						"The first U-shaped positive column lamps were put on the market in 1932, a very busy year in which three generations of sodium lamp were introduced and promptly superseded! They were known as type SO/H, SO denoting SOdium vapour and the /H implying that the lamp had to be burned horizontally. For the first time in this year, the solid borate glass was abandoned because it was expensive and so difficult to work with, and it was succeeded by an ordinary soda-lime glass tube having a thin layer of borate blown onto its inner surface. The tube was bent into a U-shape, and an oxide coated electrode was sealed into each end of the tube using the reverse-pinch kind of seal that Philips had invented for its DC lamps. The lead wires were soldered to the base contacts of a porcelain bayonet cap, and an enamelled iron fork gave mechanical support to the U-tube and located the bend inside a dimple in the inner side of the dewar jacket. The fork was electrically connected to one of the electrodes and served as a third auxiliary external electrode to facilitate ignition of the discharge.\n\t\tIf the discharge tube was run in free air, thermal losses would prevent it from getting hot enough to vaporise the sodium with the effect that the lamp would never run up. To achieve the optimum temperature of 260°C without providing an external heater, some form of thermal insulation was required. The lamp with the best insulation would be the most efficient since less power would be needed to keep it warm. Heat is lost from the discharge tube by conduction, convection and radiation and the ideal lamp should minimise each of these three loss mechanisms.\n\t\tConduction and convection losses were greatly reduced by a relatively simple approach - the discharge tube was mounted inside a separate, detachable dewar vacuum jacket. Heat is conserved as it cannot be conducted or convected across the vacuum space in the jacket. The principle is just the same as when we use a Thermos vacuum flask, say, to keep a drink of coffee warm. However SO/H did little to combat the loss of radiated heat, and conduction and convection losses from the discharge tube to the air space around it prevented efficacy from increasing further. An SO/H lamp is shown diagramatically in Figure S21 and some examples have been photographed and can be viewed with individual details from the main page of this website.",
						"The first SO/H lamps were offered by Philips in four wattages, details of which can be found in Table S1 below. All lamps were rated for 2,500 hours service (Dorgelo and Bouma, 1937). It is not stated whether these figures apply to 100-hour values or average through-life performance, but the former would seem to be the more common figure for lamps of this era.",
						"Soon after 1937, a new glass type was made which offered a reduced rate of argon adsorption and thereafter lamps could be produced with a smaller dose of that efficacy-sapping gas.  The new gas filling increased lamp efficacy by a small amount, and the lamps were re-rated to lower wattages to keep the luminous flux roughly the same for each size. The data for new re-rated SO/H lamps is quoted in Table S2, these being 100 hour values (Philips UK Catalogue, 1943).",
						"One of the principal problems with all dewar-jacketed lamps was that as they cooled after switching-off, the air around the discharge tube contracted, thus drawing in cold air from outside. This often carried dust into the lamp, which gradually built up and absorbed light. In addition if moisture was drawn in, this would form films of condensation and being an electrical conductor, wet lamps were often very difficult to strike up in the evenings of the colder seasons. In the early days public lighting engineers would walk the streets on humid evenings and manually switch on and off the lantern in question in the hope that it would strike up after a few attempts.\n\t\tBTH-Mazda was the only firm to attack these issues and their lamps were the favoured brand for many years. A pair of sachets of silica gel were attached to the U-bend of the lamp to absorb moisture, and in the 85W rating which was the most difficult size to start up owing to its long tube of slim diameter, the glass was also coated with a water-repellent silicone film. At one point, the company also included a xenon component in the gasfilling of the 85W lamp because the this rating has the highest electrical loading on the glass, and argon absorption by the glass was causing premature lamp failure. It was first discovered by Osram-GEC that xenon is not absorbed by the glass and the BTH 85W lamps gave considerably longer life, although the high atomic weight of xenon did result in the loss of some 12% lumens.\n\t\tIn 1955 a new kind of glass was introduced by Philips which offered considerably enhanced resistance to sodium corrosion. A disadvantage however, was that liquid sodium exhibited rather poor adhesion to its surface and if not kept absolutely level, it would flow around the lamp forming large light-blocking mirrors. Although it improved lumen maintenance figures due to reduced browning of the glass, this was largely offset as a result of the formation of sodium mirrors. To combat that problem, the so-called 'Bamboo' lamp was invented by Philips and also manufactured very briefly by Osram-GEC a few years later. The glass was rilled in at several points giving it the appearance of a bamboo cane, and the ridges were successful in preventing the liquid sodium from flowing around the lamp (Figure S22).",
						"The new glass had another drawback though, in that it absorbed argon at a much faster rate than the previous composition which would become stained brown rather rapidly. To attain a useful lamp life, the rare gas filling was changed at this time to a neon-xenon-helium mixture.  The elimination of argon increased lamp life, but the new gas reduced lamp efficacy due to increased eleastic and inelastic collisions. However this was a penalty that affected only new lamps.  During life it was more than offset by the greater light transmission of the new glass which did not stain so rapidly. Lamp efficacy for the 140W model rose from 76 to 84 lm/W as a result.\n\t\tMeanwhile BTH Mazda set up its own production of a sodium resistant hard glass which marked an important step forward for that company. The borosilicate 2-ply tubing it created was chemically stable while also having good adhesion to liquid sodium and a fairly low argon cleanup rate. Thus their lamps, except the 85W as noted above, could operate at somewhat higher efficacy - up to 87lm/W for the 140W rating. A further advantage, and in fact the main reason why that hard glass was developed, was that it had a lower coefficient of thermal expansion than the Philips/Osram soft glasses and the occurrence of cracking in production and service was almost totally eliminated. There was a severe price penalty for the use of this glass though, and once an improved soft glass had been developed, production reverted to that style and the usual greater production scrap rates associated with soft glass were accepted.\n\t\tThe argon cleanup problem of the new soft glass was solved in 1958 by treating the glass with excess argon during manufacture, and in that year the efficacy of Philips and Osram sodium lamps increased from 84 and joined the 87lm/W figure of BTH because they also could re-adopt the former neon/argon gas filling.\n\t\tAround the same time, Philips pioneered the introduction of small dimples in the sides of the discharge tube, which formed cool spots and served as sodium reservoirs to hold the sodium in place. This offered a marked improvement over the bamboo and earlier lamps because the dimples, being cold spots, slowed the rate of sodium being distilled towards the U-bend.  A better distribution of sodium vapour along the tube length was maintained during life, and as a result lumen maintenance was greatly improved.  Whereas the bamboo lamps tended to drop to about 60-65% lumen maintenance at the end of their 4000-hour rated life, the dimpled lamps attained about 75-80%.  Another advantage of the dimples is that the sodium is concentrated in globules of greater thickness and smaller diameter.  This has a positive effect in reducing the light-blocking effect caused by sodium mirrors in earlier lamps, and contributes about 3.5% improvement in luminous flux.\n\t\tDue to the fragility of the exposed dimples, they were only employed in SO/H detatchable lamps for a brief period.  It was very easy to scratch the glass surface during insertion into the dewar jacket.  Additionally the diameter of the inner wall of the dewar jacket was set so as to accommodate the ordinary discharge tubes - but the dimples approached the wall of the dewar much more closely, and if not perfectly aligned, vibration may cause the inner to impact the dewar and lead to breakage of the dimples.  Some references state that they were introduced as early as 1956, but quickly withdrawn after their introduction on the SO/H type lamps and production reverted to the earlier bamboo design, because the rate of breakage was too high.  The dimples made a renewed appearance following the 1958 introduction of Philips' first Integral-style lamp, which is covered in the next section.  Other references however state that the dimples were only first introduced on the dewar-type lamps in 1958, and that production of the sodium lamps was upgraded directly in that same year to the Integral design."

						"To combat some of the disadvantages of the SO/H lamp which were mentioned previously, a range of so-called 'Integral' SOI/H lamps was invented by Osram-GEC and put on the market in 1955. The dewar jacket which had accompanied all low pressure sodium lamps up to this time was dispensed with, and instead a one-piece sealed on evacuated outer bulb enclosed the discharge tube. This was expected to reduce thermal conduction and convection losses from the discharge tube to the inner wall of the former dewar jacket, and bring about an increase in lamp efficacy.\n\t\tHowever contrary to popular belief, this change in fact did very little to improve thermal insulation and did not account for any significant increase in initial lamp efficacy. The performance of the dewar jacket was so good that depsite the fact there was indeed some heat from the discharge tube to the air surrounding it, the system quickly reached equilibrium and after a few tens of minutes there was no further significant heat loss. In fact as explained earlier in the section concerning sodium migration, this sheath of air was quite advantageous and its replacement with vacuum brought with it a major new problem. Nevertheless, the one-piece outer jacket justified its use by dramatically attacking the rate of lumen depreciation throughout lamp life, through eliminating the progressive ingress of dust into the lamp. The occurrence of troublesome, conductive films of moisture on the discharge tube surface was also prevented, resulting in much more reliable lamp ignition. Lastly the design of course also resulted in a more compact, cheaper, and lightweight product which had commercial advantages. An example of the first slimline integral lamp is illustrated in Figure S24.",
						"Improvements in the thermal insulation of sodium lamps had thus far concentrated only on reducing the conducted and convected thermal losses. In 1956 the problem of radiated heat loss was addressed by Osram-GEC, who placed an ordinary glass sleeve around each limb of the discharge tube of its 140W lamps - the lower wattages receiving the same treatment in 1958. Figure S23a on this page shows an end-view of the arrangement in this lamp. The glass sleeves direct roughly half the radiated heat back onto the discharge tube while only absorbing about 3% light. The crucial effect of this was that the wall temperature increased, and thus to bring it back to the optimum level of 260°C, the tube diameter had to be increased. This resulted in a corresponding fall in current density within the discharge tube, and it has already been explained that sodium lamps are most efficient when operated with a lower discharge current density.\n\t\tThe introduction by GEC of the large bore discharge tube raised the efficacy of the 140W lamp to a new all-time high of 93 lm/W. The specifications of typical SOI/H lamps can be found in Table S3 below(Philips UK Catalogue, 1965 and Light &amp; Lighting p.248). New 200W and 300W lamps also joined the low pressure sodium range at this time. The outer jacket diameter was necessarily increased back up to the original sizes employed with SO/H lamps, to accommodate the wide bore discharge tube and extra glass insulation sleeves.",
						"Osram's patent on the wide bore glass sleeved design prevented competitors from copying it directly. However Philips managed to circumvent the patent by mounting a single large diameter heat-reflecting sleeve around both limbs of the discharge tube. This was an improvement over the former dewar-style lamp, but it did not offer such good insulation as in Osram's lamps. The larger bore discharge tube could not be employed, so the efficacy of its lamps was not so high. The use of double and triple sleeves was trialled, however no more than two were used in production since as more sleeves are added, more light is absorbed and there comes a point when efficacy beings to fall off again despite the thermal insulation being better. An end-view of the Philips construction is detailed in Figure S25. BTH Mazda was not active at all in the production of Integral lamps, since the company had at that time decided to focus its efforts entirely on a new concept, the Linear Sodium lamp, which offered still further advantages over both of these integral developments.",
						"Unfortunately, the integral design brought with it the new problem of sodium migration in both company's lamps. The vacuum around the discharge tube does not provide a uniform temperature distribution along its length, which was previously ensured by the turbulent air movement around SO/H discharge tubes. The electrode end of the lamp always runs slightly hotter than the bend end due to power losses ahead of the electrodes, thus sodium migrates (in fact it is distilled) along the temperature gradient from hot areas to cold. It accumulates near the U-bend, with the hotter areas becoming depleted of sodium vapour and the discharge in these regions can revert to a pure neon discharge. The neon discharge generates more heat than the sodium discharge, which further heats the already sodium-depleted regions and exacerbates the problem.\n\t\tTo counteract the trend for sodium to migrate to the U-bend, in many SOI lamps it will be seen that the glass is constricted here to bring it closer to the discharge and increase wall temperature. In certain Philips lamps, a layer of heat-reflective platinum paint was applied to the outside of the bend instead. Both techniques were partially successful in increasing the bend temperature to reduce migration effects. However it was not until the development of the IR-coated SOX type lamp that this sodium migration issue was effectively solved.\n\t\tA further design feature which had to be addressed was that in SO lamps, ignition was facilitated by the long enamelled metal fork which supported the discharge tube and acted as a third auxiliary electrode. This support was not required in SOI, but to ensure reliable ignition, GEC replaced it with a pair of nickel wires spiralled around each limb of the U-tube and connected to the cathode of the adjacent limb. Once again this design was protected by the company's patents, and Philips instead used a short length of enamelled wire which ran alongside one of the limbs of the discharge tube for just a few centimetres. Figure S26 illustrates the eventual construction which was employed in the mass-produced lamps of both the Osram-GEC and Philips SOI styles.",
						"It is not easy to achieve a high vacuum in the outer jacket of the lamp, and it is even more difficult to keep once it has been obtained, because the internal components will continue to outgas over time. It is for this reason that a chemical 'getter' is employed in the outer jacket of all intergral-type sodium lamps. This not only helps to initially achieve the required vacuum, but maintains it throughout lamp life. Sodium lamps employ a barium getter which consists of a mirror of that metal on the inside of the outer bulb (normally near the cap where it doesn’t interfere with light output). Barium is a highly reactive metal which chemically removes many impurity gases from the atmosphere in the lamp. Disappearance or tarnishing of the mirror means that the outer bulb no longer has the required vacuum. Figure S27 illustrates how the efficiency of the lamp varies with the quality of the outer bulb vacuum."

						"The technique of employing glass sleeves in SOI/H lamps to minimise radiation losses is not a particularly efficient solution, since each sleeve only redirects about half the radiated heat back into the discharge tube. During the 1960s the primary focus of research on the low pressure sodium lamp was engaged in the search for new materials which could more efficiently trap infrared wavelengths while being transparent to light.\n\t\tThe earliest developments employed pure metallic coatings applied to the outer envelope.  These form superb infra-red reflectors, but brought the drawback of absorbing much of the extra light they helped to generate. Eventually it was discovered that certain metallic oxide coatings displayed the desired property of high infrared reflection combined with high visible transmission.  The heating effect of the IR coating allowed lamp wattages to be reduced while maintaining the discharge tube at the optimum temperature.  The resulting reduction in electrical current density in the discharge tube is then responsible for an increase in luminous efficacy.\n\t\tTo illustrate the significance of the IR coating in bringing the discharge tube up to its correct operating temperature, the demonstration lamp shown in Figure S28 has been specially made up (courtesy of Philips Lighting Hamilton Factory, Scotland).  One half of the outer bulb is coated with the normal indium-tin-oxide IR film, while the other half has been chemically etched to remove the coating and return it to clear glass. After running for a short period under normal conditions, it is evident that the left hand side of the lamp has fully run-up whereas the much lower temperatures on the right hand side of the lamp have resulted in only a very small amount of sodium ionisation.",
						"Incidentally, the uncoated region of the lamp is too hot to touch whereas the coated area remains relatively cool, demonstrating that heat loss is of course considerably greater without the coating.  The impressive thermal insulation effects of the IR coating are revealed in the thermal image of the same lamp in Figure S29.  This shows that the glass surface temperature in the coated region is about 60°C, whereas in the uncoated area temperatures in excess of 100°C are attained.",
						"The first commercial lamp to employ a thin-film heat reflector was a 60-watt Linear Sodium lamp manufactured by Osram-GEC, which employs a 15-nanometre thick film of pure gold on the inside of the outer jacket.  For obvious reasons it was marketed for a few years under the trade name \"GEC Golden Linear\".  The same coating was also applied to the company's 160W and 200W Linear Sodium, in which the gold reflected a very high proportion of heat back into the discharge tube and allowed its diameter to be increased, thus reducing discharge current density and enhancing the luminous efficacy. However the gold film absorbs a considerable amount of the extra light that it helps to generate. Applied as a full coating along the entire lamp it would have raised discharge efficacy superbly, but absorbed so much light that the total lamp efficacy would actually be reduced. Gold films were not practical for the U-shaped lamps because they absorbed more light than the extra they generated, but owing to a unique feature of the Linear Sodium lamp, covered in the next section, they were suitable for that design. The Linear Sodium discharge tube has a non-circular cross-section and it emits more light in one plane than the other. By applying the gold coating in the form of two broad stripes, the plane of the discharge tube can be aligned such that its surface which radiates most light is oriented alongside a clear stripe in the outer jacket for good transmission.  The gold film was applied only alongside the less luminous sides of the discharge tube. An additional gain of about 30% light transmission could be attained with the use of an auxiliary antireflection zinc sulphide film applied over the gold, but this was too expensive to be applied to commercial lamp designs.\n\t\tGerman Osram also manufactured 175W and 220W linear sodium lamps for a very brief period - these employed films of bismuth to circumvent Osram-GEC's patent on the use of gold, and not being quite so efficient, consumed a higher wattage than the GEC's 160W and 200W equivalent products for an equivalent luminous flux.",
						"Further improvements came with the use of metal oxide semiconductor films, the use of which was pioneered by Philips on the conventional U-Tube Integral lamps. The first material used was tin oxide and this had a very high light transmission while still being an excellent infra red reflector. As such, it could be applied over the whole surface of the lamp's outer jacket with only minimal absorption of the visible light.  In 1964, the new super-efficient semiconductor coated lamps were placed on the marked and the SOX name was introduced at that time. SOX lamps were launched in wattages of 40W, 60W, 100W and 150W to replace the former 60W, 85W, 140W and 200W glass sleeved SOI types, specifications of which are detailed in Table S4 (Philips UK Lamp Catalogue, 1966). Curiously and for unknown reason, no SOX replacement was offered for the smallest 45W SOI lamp.\n\t\tOwing to the fact that the coating thickness was quite uniform along the length of the tube, the use of sodium-retaining dimples was essential to prevent sodium migration along the lamp.  Osram-GEC quickly copied the Philips development and manufactured its own range of tin-oxide coated SOX lamps.  These were technically similar to the Philips models, and also employed dimpled discharge tubes.  Osram-GEC wasted no time in adapting the same coating for its 60W, 160W and 200W Linear Sodium products, superseding the former metallic coatings of gold.  Thorn Lighting (who had taken over AEI Mazda in the same year) also began to employ tin oxide films in its Linear Sodium range, which was offered in 60W and 200W ratings.",
						"Two years later in 1966, an improved coating of tin-doped indium oxide was developed by Philips, and this offered even greater transmission of the sodium yellow light. These appear to have been marketed as from 1968.  On account of their superior efficacy, the SOX range was re-rated to new lower wattages, having approximately the same luminous flux. Lamp wattage was reduced to 35W, 55W, 90W, 135W and 180W. Technical specifications for Re-Rated SOX are given in Table S5.  Notice that new smaller 18W and 10W sources were also introduced following the improvement in efficacy that their coatings allowed.",
						"At this time, Thorn offered a High Output 200W Linear Sodium based partly on the improved coating, and this delivered 10% more light than the old design for no extra power consumption. The indium film was also employed in a new 140W rating which was introduced in 1966. 60W and standard 200W products continued to make use of the earlier tin oxide films until those products were made obsolete in 1985.\n\t\tThe tin-doped indium oxide film is the standard coating material which is still found on today's SOX lamps. Tin is required as it increases the number of free charge carriers in the film and makes it a better heat reflector than plain indium oxide. Figure S30 illustrates how the transmission and reflection of this film varies with wavelength. The transmission is high for sodium light (around 589nm), so about 90% of the light generated can pass through the outer bulb. Most of the infrared radiated from the discharge tube is at about 5500nm, and the graph shows that reflection of this is high, thus the coating is a very effective heat reflector.\n\t\tBetter IR reflection can be achieved by increasing the film thickness, but the thicker film also transmits less light, reducing efficacy. A compromise has been chosen between infrared reflection and visible transmission, to give maximum efficacy. This works out to a film thickness of about 0.32 microns. Such a coating usually imparts a greenish colour to reflections observed in the coated surface. Earlier tin oxide lamps are distinguishable by the fact that surface reflections appear yellow in the Linear style, and orange for the U-tube style",
						"SOX-E (Economy) lamps are similar to standard types but have better thermal insulation so they are even more efficient. The efficiency can be further improved by running them on special SOX-E control gear, which operates the lamp at its optimum (lower) current loading of 0.3 amps for the low wattage sizes, and 0.6A for the larger lamps. Under these conditions, lamp efficacy can as high as 200 lm/W, but of course, total light output from the same size lamp falls because it is being operated at lower current. Technical specifications for the SOX-E series is detailed in Table S6 below.",
						"It is not currently practical to apply the IR coating to the domed end of the outer bulb, so in standard SOX lamps heat is lost through this 'window' of clear glass E lamps have extra insulation at the domed end of the lamp which may take the form of a highly reflective metal disc, or a heat reflecting cap which is clipped over the outside of the bend. As the heat losses are been reduced, lamp efficacy rises. The IR coating is also slightly superior on the E lamps made by Philips and Osram, and generally these have a reddish colour tint to light reflections seen in their surfaces.\n\t\tIn Figure S31 is a photograph of a tin oxide lamp, and indium oxide lamp, and an improved indium oxide SOX-E lamp The colour of light reflections in these coatings can be seen to be orange, green and reddish-pink respectively."

						"In the design of high efficiency low pressure sodium lamps, six key parameters must be optimised to deliver the best performing lamps. These are as follows:Discharge tube operating close to 260°C. Excellent thermal insulation. Low discharge current density. Large surface area to volume ratio for discharge tube. Low inert gas filling pressure. Efficient electrode design.",
						"While each of these criteria is fairly easy to obtain by itself, there are some conflicts. The most notable of these is the fact that both a low current density and a large surface area to volume ratio is called for.\n\t\tLow current density calls for long discharge tubes of large diameter, thus explaining the large physical size of the low pressure sodium lamp. However, efficacy also rises for discharge tubes having a large surface area to volume ratio. The reason for this is that sodium vapour is opaque to its own yellow resonance radiation, i.e. it self-absorbs its own light. If a large diameter discharge tube is employed the efficiency of light generation is very high, but the efficiency of light extraction is poor because much of the light created at the core of the discharge tube is absorbed before it can escape.\n\t\tIn practical lamp design, there is a cross-over point where the two conditions can be chosen to deliver a fair compromise. Increasing tube diameter from this value may create a more efficient discharge, but total efficacy falls due to self-absorption. Decreasing tube diameter results in better light extraction, but luminous efficacy still falls because of the increase in current density. Low wattage sodium lamps operate at a discharge current of 0.6 Amps and for the SOX versions, a tube of approximately 12mm inside diameter has been chosen as the optimum. High wattage lamps operate at 0.9 Amps and for these a 16mm diameter discharge tube is employed. In the SOX-E range, extra efficacy is attained by operating the low watts lamps at 0.3-0.45A but in the same tube diameter, and the high watts at 0.6A, again in the same larger bore tube. Although efficacy is increased drastically, luminous flux falls because the power loading in a tube of the same dimensions is lower.",
						"In the 1950's, some very innovative thinking at BTH Mazda delivered a radical new concept in sodium discharge tube design - namely the employment of tubes having non-circular cross-sections. By moving away from a circular tube to a design having a greater surface area to volume ratio, sodium light transmission can be considerably enhanced while also permitting the use of large diameter tubes which offer a low current density. Several dozens of discharge tube geometries were considered and tested, many of which were horrendously difficult to manufacture and were only ever laboratory samples.\n\t\tBy 1959, AEI Mazda had completed its development, and the Linear Sodium lamp was placed on the market. The first product was a 200 watt lamp delivering 20,000 lumens, a very significant milestone in lighting history because this was the first commercially available light source to break the 100 lumen per watt barrier. Other types rated 250W, 150W and 100W arrived shortly afterwards. At the heart of these lamps was a discharge tube manufactured with an alternating crescent-shaped cross section which could be moulded into the discharge tube glass relatively easily - a cross-sectional view being shown in Figure S32. A set of moulds was simultaneously depressed into one side of the heated glass tube, which was then rotated 180 degrees and the same moulds pressed into the opposite side of the glass to form the special dented shape. The primary reason for grooving the tube on alternate sides was to ensure that the photometric light distribution from each side of the lamp was symmetrical. A valuable spin-off was that it increased the discharge length by approximately 10%, so more light could be generated from shorter lamps. The concept for this shape of discharge tube originated from the PowerGroove linear fluorescent tube, which was being developed by GE of America at the same time and the full co-operation that occurred between GE and its subsidiary BTH accounts for the similarity in design of many of their lamps and production techniques.",
						"In 1959 Osram-GEC also ventured into the manufacture of Linear Sodium, employing a design substantially based on the Mazda lamp. German Osram also produced this lamp for a very brief period but withdrew it due to a lack of success selling this light source in their home market, in which white mercury light was strongly favoured. So efficient was the SLI lamp that at this time, AEI Mazda decided to cease production of the old U-shaped design and concentrate all of its efforts into Linear Sodium technology. This situation remained for more than ten years until the company was taken over by Thorn Lighting and a new SOX line was constructed.",
						'Linear sodium lamps were initially of the Integral design, in which the discharge tube was sealed into a one-piece evacuated outer bulb. One or two glass sleeves surrounded the inner tube and served to minimise thermal radiation losses in just the same way as SOI Integral lamps. The linear equivalents soon adopted their own name SLI to differentiate them as being linear products.\n\t\tIn 1965, Osram-GEC made a second major breakthrough in enhancing the efficacy of Linear sodium lamps. The company was successful in eliminating the glass heat conserving sleeves and replaced them with a thin film of metallic gold sputtered onto the inside of the outer jacket, which offered far better thermal insulation. Two clear stripes were left in the glass, these uncoated portions being aligned with the sides of the discharge tube which radiated most light so as to maximise light transmission efficacy without seriously compromising heat insulation. Osram\'s new products were marketed as the "Golden Linear" range for a number of years in sizes of 60W and 175W. These operated on the same control gear as the AEI-Mazda 60W and 200W versions, with a small reduction in power consumption for the same luminous flux.  German Osram employed films of Bismuth which was not quite so efficient, and offered a more powerful and dimensionally larger lamp of 220W.\n\t\tIn 1964 Philips launched U-shaped sodium lamps having a greatly improved coating consisting of tin oxide. This semiconductor material offered excellent infra-red reflection but with minimal light absorption, and the SOX type IR-coated lamps were launched at this time SLI products were quick to adopt this new material.\n\t\tBy 1967-68 the IR coating had been improved again, thanks to an indium-tin oxide material which offered even greater reater efficacy.  The SOX lamps were re-rated to lower wattages with the introduction of this coating. The only SLI lamp to adopt the indium film was a new 140W product launched by Thorn Lighting, the successor of AEI Mazda. The 140W SLI lamp was designed for operation on a 90W SOX ballast and had an incredible 142 lumen per watt efficacy. The rest of the SLI range continued to be made with tin oxide coatings. As with SOX lamps, tin and indium coated SLI products can be differentiated by the colour of the surface reflections in the glass - these are yellow coloured for tin lamps, and green for indium.',
						"In 1966 Thorn Lighting (the successor of AEI Mazda) invested heavily in SLI production and made a number of improvements in an attempt to fight off the increasing popularity of the new SOX lamp, which the company did not manufacture at that time.  Most significant was the company's investment in automatic glassblowing lathes capable of forming the discharge tube into some of the very complex shapes which had been tested in the 1950's but were not economical to manufacture at that time. Thorn's new lamps abandoned the simple crescent-shape grooved tube in favour of a lamp having a four-leaf clover style cross section, and this has a very large surface area to volume ratio. Eighty-eight small ridges were moulded along the apex of the 'leaves', and these indents, affectionately known as greenhouses because of their shape, served as sodium retention reservoirs. In 1980 a further gain in efficacy was made in which an even more complex 5-leaf clover tube was introduced with the new 200W High Output lamp. Figure S33 illustrates the cross-section of the 4-leaf clover tube.",
						"Shortly after the time of the change in shape, the rare gas filling was also modified to optimise performance. An addition of 0.05% Xenon permitted the argon concentration to be dropped and because xenon is not absorbed by the borate glass employed in sodium lamps, gas life was extended. More significantly though, xenon allowed the total gas filling pressure to be reduced to much lower levels. A corresponding increase in efficacy was achieved, resulting from there being fewer elastic and inelastic collisions between the active discharge and the rare gas. However this would have been accompanied by a decrease in lamp life had a new electrode design also not been introduced because lower gas pressures result in an increased rate of loss of the emitter coating on the electrodes. Figure S34 shows the difference in discharge colour of the rare gas in old and new style lamps. The characteristic red neon-argon colour formerly employed is seen above, while the faint purple discharge below is that of the improved neon-argon-xenon mixture.",
						"Electrodes in sodium lamps have traditionally taken the form of triple coiled tungsten wire, dipped in emitter and with the emitter filling the spaces between the coils. In this design, emitter is free to be mechanically shaken off through the powerful low-frequency vibrations found in streetlighting service, or it can be sputtered and evaporated away during normal lamp operation. In a spinoff from the company's work on improved cathodes for fluorescent tubes, an entirely new type of sodium electrode was developed, known as the Braided Cathode. Making use of a machine borrowed from the textiles industry, seven or eight fine wires of tungsten were braided into a hollow tube. The tube itself was then coiled to form the electrode. At the emitter impregnation stage, this chemical was drawn right inside the braided tube and each cathode of a given size and rating could hold a far greater amount of emitter. Thus lamp life could be enhanced tremendously. The braided cathode resulted in the company doubling the life of its entire fluorescent lamp range immediately, and its application to Linear Sodium technology helped make the new clover-leaf style lamps more long lived than ever before. Figure S35 illustrates a highly magnified view of the braided cathode.",
						"Aside from being the first practical lamp to pass the 100lm/W mark, Linear Sodium also holds another record in lighting history. It was the first light source which was put to use in motorway illumination - until 1971 only inner city streets and main trunk roads had been illuminated. In that year however, the first motorway lighting installation was commisioned, consisting of 1200 of the Thorn 140W SLI/H lamps on the M1 motorway between London and Luton. The lamps were operated in the AEI's Amberline SLI lantern, which later became better known as Thorn Lighting's Alpha Five luminaire.\n\t\tBefore concluding the section on Linear Sodium, it is of interest to note that Osram-GEC made many experiments at its Hirst Research Centre in Wembley on High Pressure Sodium lamps having similarly shaped ceramic arc tubes of non-circular section. Rather than enhancing the discharge efficacy, the primary goal here was to deliver an asymmetric radiation of light to better suit streetlighting optics. Some designs were very complex and even had lenses and fresnel patterns moulded into the ceramic discharge tube itself. Despite encouraging results, the production costs were prohibitively high at the time. Full details are disclosed in S.A. Rigden's US Patent 3,885,181 of 1975."

					description: [
						"Although the high voltage lamps described previously brought numerous advantages over the original low voltage developments, a notable disadvantage of both types in the early years was the complexity of the electrical control gear required to operate them.  In addition to the simple ballasting task to control discharge current, means also had to be provided to ignite the discharge.\n\t\tDuring the early 1930s a third family of low pressure sodium lamp was developed by German Osram in an attempt to overcome this limitation.  The concept was based on the high voltage style with the addition of special features such that the discharge could be initiated at ordinary mains voltages.  This greatly simplified the electrical arrangements to permit the use of an ordinary choke-type ballast, in the same fashion as the increasingly popular mercury vapour lamps.\n\t\tThis style of self-starting lamp was manufactured by both Osram and Philips, but its commercial success (or lack thereof) is illustrated by the fact that both companies abandoned its production after a few years.  Partly this was owing to the fact that its efficacy was not terribly good, but also because it was an expensive lamp to produce.  Meanwhile developments in control gear had allowed a reduction in the cost and complexity of the autoleak-reactance type of transformer which has since become commonplace for the operation of high voltage sodium lamps.  Nevertheless the construction of the self-starting lamps is technically interesting and only sparesely documented, so they will be described in detail under this section.",
						"The ignition voltage of the self-starting lamps is reduced below that of mains potential by combining at least the first two of the following four design features.  In some lamp types the third and/or fourth mechanisms may be employed as well:\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe discharge tube diameter is increased and its length decreased by comparison with standard high voltage lamps.  Both of these features lead to a lower striking voltage, but bring the drawback of reduced efficacy owing to the fact that the current density of the discharge is higher than the optimum level.\n\t\t\tOne or two glass-sleeved isolated wires are disposed within the discharge tube, running along most of its length except for a short gap usually near one or both electrodes, and sometimes also at the centre of the discharge tube.  Before the lamp starts the full mains potential is applied across these gaps and on account of the short distance, the rare gas filling of the discharge tube can be ionised at a relatively low voltage.  A high series resistance is provided in parallel with these wires so that once ionisation has taken place, the discharge transfers to the main electrodes.\n\t\t\tAn auxiliary electrode may be provided in the close proximity one of the main electrodes and connected via a second high resistance to the electrode at the opposite end of the discharge tube.  The principle of operation is same as the probe electrode in the mercury vapour lamp.\n\t\t\tFinally, one or more of the main electrodes may be preheated prior to lamp starting, so as to liberate electrons by thermionic emission.\n\t\t\n\tSelf-starting LPS lamps were developed in two different formats: double ended and single ended.  Each type is described in futher detail on the following pages."

						"The self-starting sodium lamps were first developed in this double-ended format, and are believed to have originated from Osram's Berlin laboratories in 1931.  They exist in two versions, the first of which is known as the Na300-56W.  A few years later it was joined by the Na600-100W variant.  The first number refers to the luminous flux in dekalumens and on the German Hefner lumen scale, which differs slightly from the present day international lumen.  One Hefner Lumen = 0.903 Lumens.  As such their luminous flux is 3000 and 6000 Hlm, which equates to approximately 2700 and 5400 lm.  The second number refers to the power consumption, 56W and 100W respectively.  They were manufactured only by Osram and are believed to have been discontinued prior to 1940.  A typical example is shown in Figure S36.",
						"It is interesting to note that whereas most low pressure sodium lamps have been developed to deliver the maximum luminous efficacy, these early linear sources appear to have been optimised instead for generating the maximum luminous flux with a high surface luminance.  This is evidenced in Figure S38, which shows the characteristics of the Na300-56W system as a function of mains voltage variations.  It is clear that in the range of typical mains voltages from 220-260V this lamp delivers maximum luminous flux, whereas the optimum point in terms of luminous efficacy would be reached at much lower mains voltages.",
						"The low efficacy is a natural result of the relatively short discharge length, which gives rise to a high discharge current density.  A secondary effect of the short discharge is that the lamp voltage is rather low, which means that more power is dissipated in the ballast thus penalising system efficacy.  A further drawback of the double ended lamps is their reliance on preheating of the electrodes, which makes the control gear rather complex.  Yet another weakness is the fact that the low preheating current available from the ballast necessitates electrodes of rather flimsy construction, and it is presumed that their lifetime would have been inferior to the heavy electrodes employed in other sodium lamps.",
						"Owing to the small diameter light source of high brightness (about 14 stilb), good optical control is possible.  Its first application was for the floodlighting of the inner courtyards of Osram's Berlin buildings in August 1931.  During the mid 1930s a number of more extensive streetlighting trials were set up by Osram in Germany, Austria, Italy, Norway, Sweden and Finland.  Figure S39 shows a typical installation in suspended lanterns on a short stretch of the road between Köln and Bonn in Germany, 1934.",
						"In both sizes the discharge tube is made from a short length of wide bore tubing.  It contains an isolated wire, encapsulated over most of its length within a small diameter glass tube.  Sometimes the wire in the tube takes the form of a finely coiled tungsten filament, and it is unclear whether or not this plays any heating role to further lower the lamp ignition voltage.  The tube is pierced with a small hole near its mid-point to allow the inner space to be evacuated during lamp production.  Probes extend from each end of the tube and terminate in close promimity to the main electrodes at either end of the discharge tube.  A small discharge initiates at these points when the lamp is first energised.  The isolated wire is electrically floating inside the discharge tube.\n\t\tThe main electrodes consist of a coil of tungsten wire bent into a simple U-shape.  They are coated with the usual oxide emission mixture and are capable of being heated to thermionic emission temperature by the discharge itself, but preheating is also provided to lower the ignition voltage.  In the earliest installations it was standard practice for both electrodes to be preheated, but later it was found that the preheating of only one electrode was sufficient for the shorter Na300-56W lamp.  In case of vertical operation, it was recommended that the lower cathode be preheated.  After ignition the cathodes are  maintained at the correct temperature by the heat of the discharge.\n\t\tThermal insulation of the discharge tube is provided by mounting it in a large diameter outer bulb which is evacuated to high vacuum.  The insulation is improved by the presence of a secondary glass sleeve which covers all of the length of the discharge tube.  This functions in the same fashion as the more modern SOI/H type lamps and serves to reflect long-wavelength infrared radiation back onto the inner discharge tube.  The discharge tube is supported within this sleeve, and the sleeve within the outer bulb with the aid of coiled springs that are located between annular dimples, usually provided in both the sleeve and the outer bulb.\n\t\tBoth lamp sizes are equipped with a large 2-prong cap, one terminal post being connected to each side of the electrodes.  This 4-pin provision allows for the necessary preheating of the electrodes.\n\t\tFigure S40 illustrates the construction of the linear self-starting lamps, which are both identical aside from a difference in length and diameter.",
						"To better understand the ignition process of the linear self-starting lamps, Figure S41 illustrates the typical wiring arrangement for both the Na300-56W and Na600-100W variants.  Note that the second preheating transformer and its associated wiring, shown in dashed lines, is only necessary for the larger lamp.\n\t\t\tUpon application of the mains potential to the input terminals of the choke, the discharge space of the lamp is not yet conductive and no current flows.  However the electrode preheating transformer(s) are wired in parallel with the lamp, so the current from the ballast instead flows through their primary windings.  A low voltage of approximately 5V is delivered at the output of the preheating transformers which causes a current of 1.5A to flow through the lamp electrodes.  After reaching thermionic emission temperatures, the gas filling is ionised in the vicinity of the electrodes, and facilitates breakdown to the adjacent probes extending from the glass-sleeved ignition wire within the discharge tube.  Owing to the negligible resistance of the discharge it then bypasses the internal starting wire and effectively short-circuits the external transformers to cut out the preheating current supplied to the electrodes.  Incidentally the ballast itself is an isolated form of choke, which is necessary to prevent the injection of high frequency osscilations into the mains supply.  A capacitor of rating 0.1µF may optionally be provided to further reduce radio frequency interference."

						"To overcome many of the limitations of the linear self-starting sodium lamps and better compete with Philips' development of the single ended high voltage lamps, Osram introduced a family of single ended self-starting lamps in 1936.  They exist in two versions known as the Na300U-53W and the Na500U-80W.  The first number refers to the luminous flux in dekalumens and on the German Hefner lumen scale, which differs slightly from the present day international lumen.  One Hefner Lumen = 0.903 Lumens.  As such their luminous flux is 3000 and 5000 Hlm, which equates to approximately 2700 and 4500 lumens.  The second number refers to the power consumption, 53W and 80W respectively.  The letter U differentiates them from the linear versions, because of the U-shaped discharge tube.\n\t\tBoth of the single ended lamps were also manufactured by Philips Eindhoven, under the slightly different nomenclature SO300 and SO500.  They are believed to have been discontinued by both Osram and Philips prior to 1940, by which time it had become clear that the high voltage lamps were the better design.  Figures S37 and S42 illustrate the construction of the Na500U-80W lamp which employs both starting aids.  The Na300U-53W is identical except for the fact that the starting probe and the secondary resistance are omitted.",
						"In both ratings the discharge tube is folded into a short U-bend made from wide bore tubing.  Each limb of the discharge tube contains an isolated wire, encapsulated over most of its length within a small diameter glass tube.  Sometimes the wire in the tube takes the form of a finely coiled tungsten filament, and it is unclear whether or not this plays any heating role to further lower the lamp ignition voltage.  The tube is pierced with a small hole near its mid-point to allow the inner space to be evacuated during lamp production.  Probes extend from the distal end of each tube into the U-bend area, with a gap of approximately one centimetre between the two which forms one of the pair of locations where the discharge is first initated upon lamp starting.  One of these isolated wires is brought outside the discharge tube via a third conductor in the press-seal, and is connected to the electrode at the opposite end of the tube via a high resistance.  The resistor is located on the centre of the mica support disc between the two limbs of the discharge tube.  The second of the isolated wires is floating inside the second limb of the discharge tube, its proximal end terminating a few millimetres from the main electrode.  This gap forms the second location where a small discharge is initiated during lamp starting.  \n\t\tIn the case of the 500 Hlm lamp only, a third auxiliary electrode is sealed into one end of the discharge tube and positioned alongside one of the main electrodes.  This is connected to the opposite main electrode by a second resistance inside the lamp's outer jacket.  This second resistor is much larger than the first and takes the form of a length of coiled resistance wire sheathed in a C-shaped ceramic tube, which is mounted around the perimeter of the mica disc.\n\t\tThe main lamp electrodes are of similar construction to the modern low pressure sodium lamps, but consist of an axial single coil of tungsten wire instead of the present beehive shape coil of triple-coiled wire.  They are coated with the usual Barium-Strontium-Calcium carbonate emission mixture and are heated to thermionic emission temperature by the discharge itself.  There is no preheating provision prior to lamp ignition.  Their feedthroughs are pinch-sealed into each end of the discharge tube and sleeved with a layer of sodium-resistant borate glass, capped with a small magnesia ceramic tube to keep liquid sodium away from the glass-metal interface.\n\t\tThermal insulation of the discharge tube is provided by sealing it into a large diameter evacuated outer bulb.  The insulation is improved by the presence of an oval-section glass tube which covers most of the length of the discharge tube.  This functions in the same fashion as the more modern SOI/H type lamps and serves to reflect long-wavelength infrared radiation back onto the inner discharge tube.  It is supported only at one end by fusing it to the crown of the outer bulb.  A coating of platinum paint is applied to the outer surface of the U-bend region to provide additional heat reflection in this area which is not covered by the secondary glass tube.\n\t\tA barium-type getter is employed to maintain high vacuum in the outer bulb during lamp life, and it is especially interesting to note the construction of this getter which is surely one of the first applications of this device in an electric lamp.  Modern barium getters consist of a barium-aluminium alloy pressed into a U-shaped nickel plated steel support, and they are heated by RF induction to trigger an exothermic reaction which evaporates the barium.  However in these early sodium lamps the getters are heated electrically.  The alloy is believed to be a barium-magnesium-aluminium powder that is packed into a small diameter ceramic tube.  A coil of tungsten or molybdenum wire is wrapped around the tube, and two additional leading-in wires are provided in the stem of the lamp's outer jacket.  These permit the getters to be electrically heated so as to evaporate their barium charge.  Thereafter two of the wires in the stem are redundant, and the remaining two are connected to the lamp cap.\n\t\tBoth lamp sizes are equipped with an E40 / GES Goliath Edison Screw cap, unusually formed in pure copper instead of the usual brass materials.  This is likely on account of its large diameter skirt for connection to the glass bulb, which is easier to form in a more ductile metal.  The cap requires only two electrical contacts in view of the fact that all starting means are contained within the discharge tube and its outer jacket.",
						"Upon application of the mains potential to the lamp terminals, the following sequence of events takes place for the 500 Hlm lamps.  It is the same for the 300 Hlm variants except that step 1 does not occur owing to the omission of the starting probe in that design.  The process is shown graphically in Figure S43.\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe easiest position for the discharge to strike is between the auxiliary probe electrode which is adjacent to one of the main electrodes.  This ionises the gas filling and generates a small amount of light which lowers the ionisation potential of the gas in its vicinity.  The discharge current is limited to a very low value by the high value of the first resistance.\n\t\t\tOwing to the great magnitude of the first resistance, the discharge promptly transfers to the easier route of breaking down between this main electrode and the end of the nearby insulated wire in that limb of the discharge tube.  To complete the circuit, breakdown also occurs at the gap in the U-bend region of the discharge tube.  The discharge current is able to increase somewhat after this step, owing to the lower value of the second resistor.  It is unclear whether or not any heating effect of the tungsten filaments in the insulated tubes takes place during this stage, which might play some further role in lowering the striking voltage.\n\t\t\tAt this moment with small discharges operating both at the U-bend and adjacent to one of the main electrodes, the gas filling becomes sufficiently conductive that a discharge is struck directly between the two main electrodes, its current being limited of course to a much higher value by the external choke that sets the main lamp current."

						"自1932年商业引入以来，低压钠灯一直保持着其作为最高效光源的令人羡慕的地位。近年来，来自其他放电灯的日益激烈的竞争导致其市场份额缓慢下降，但它仍被指定用于新安装，特别是在比利时、荷兰以及全球其他靠近重要天文观测点的地区，因为其产生的光污染大大减少。典型低压钠灯的构造如图S1所示。",
						"为了达到最佳效率，钠蒸气被保持在低压状态，这就需要一个尺寸较大、工作温度相对较低的放电管。这允许使用普通玻璃类型，如苏打石灰硅酸盐或硼硅酸盐玻璃，然而，为了减少化学腐蚀性钠蒸气的侵蚀速率，会在玻璃管内表面吹制一层特殊的硼酸盐玻璃保护层。为了减少长放电管的长度，通常将其折叠成U形，尽管也存在线性设计。放电管被注入金属钠，并且还含有惰性气体填充物，通常是基于氖气的，这有助于启动。电流通过两端的热电子电极供应，其结构与低压汞荧光灯的电极相似，但由于灯的电流较大，其结构更为坚固。放电管需要隔热以确保高灯效率，这通过将其安装在次级外灯泡内来实现。它被抽真空以最小化热传导和对流损失，在更现代的灯中，其内表面涂有一层红外反射膜以最小化辐射热损失。外灯泡配备有卡口式或针式灯头，以确保放电管在灯具光学系统中的正确对齐。",
						"低压钠放电之所以具有令人瞩目的高效率，并不是因为它将电能转化为可见光特别高效，而是因为其辐射的光的波长恰好非常接近人眼在正常观看条件下的峰值灵敏度。图S2显示了典型低压钠灯的能量平衡，揭示了实际上只有大约30%的输入功率被转化为可见光。这个百分比与其他现代放电灯相当。图S3同时展示了其光谱叠加在人眼灵敏度曲线上，显示其辐射接近最有效的波长。",
						"多年来，该灯在材料和制造技术方面不断改进，使其始终保持着作为最高效光源的地位。图S4展示了各种主要光源技术随时间的效率提升情况，从技术上讲，低压钠灯没有理由就此止步。然而，制造商是否认为在进一步改进上进行必要的投资具有商业吸引力则是另一回事！这一事实本身是自20世纪90年代以来低压钠灯线趋于平坦的原因，当时对这项技术的所有进一步研究实际上都停止了。\n\t\t从这张图表中可以注意到，自每种光源技术诞生以来，它通常在其效率排名中始终保持相对位置——很少超越或落后于竞争光源。唯一的例外是半导体发光二极管，它只是在非常近的时期才经历了严肃的发展。毫无疑问，这种独特的光源将在效率方面超越许多竞争对手，然而，尚待观察的是LED是否可以在其他领域，特别是光通量和成本方面得到发展，从而开始威胁到其他光源。低压钠灯在图表顶部占据的首要位置预计将在未来许多年内保持不变。",
						"低压钠光具有许多独特的属性，这些属性源于其光谱输出，其中许多使其在技术上成为道路照明最合适的光源，这些内容将在下一页详细介绍。此外，灯的大尺寸意味着它具有低表面亮度，因此不太可能产生眩光，低工作温度允许使用紧凑的光学系统和轻质塑料灯具。它们是隧道照明的首选光源，特别是在日本和韩国，地下道路延伸10英里或更长并不罕见。长灯可以首尾相连，形成一条连续的光线，这几乎完全消除了高速驶过高亮度灯光时的频闪效应。驾驶员疲劳大幅减少，低压钠灯照明与隧道内事故率降低之间有着经过充分证明的联系。荧光灯也适用于这一应用，但SOX提供了一个更节能的解决方案。\n\t\t此外，灯本身相对便宜，可以在低成本电气控制装置上运行。越来越重要的是，它不含汞，可以在其使用寿命结束时作为无毒废物轻松处理，而无需额外费用。大多数高压钠灯和其他用于街道照明的光源都含有汞，对废弃灯的处理有特殊限制。另一个优势是，在瞬间电源中断的情况下，灯会在电源恢复时重新点燃，无需冷却期。\n\t\t燃烧位置通常限制在水平位置±20°。更大的倾斜角度可能导致液态钠流向灯的下端，结果是灯的上部钠蒸气耗尽，效率降低。垂直燃烧仅允许低功率灯使用，但只有灯头朝上时才允许。灯头朝下照明会导致钠在电极后方积聚，而该区域的玻璃与金属密封是一个薄弱环节，在过量钠的存在下可能会失效。",
						"没有一种光源提供一整套优势，SOX灯当然也不例外。它的一个主要弱点是在其单色光下无法进行颜色渲染。虽然在户外照明中这不一定是限制，甚至在街道照明中可能有益，但其主要弱点是其额定寿命比其他类型放电灯短。典型安装每两年需要更换灯泡，而高压钠灯的昂贵维护周期可以延长至三到四年，后者的维护成本降低完全可以抵消低压钠灯的节能成本。\n\t\t1994年引入的长寿命SOX-Plus灯是为了应对这一变化，但只取得了部分成功，因为灯本身基本没有变化，只是延长了保证期。2003年引入的SOX-PSG灯是一个更令人满意的解决方案，其中在6000小时之前，即正常路灯服务的前18个月内，完全消除了过早故障。使用这种灯，三年维护周期是完全可行的，该灯在12000小时燃烧后达到92%的存活率。尽管低压钠技术可能还有空间进一步延长其使用寿命，但制造商可以从更现代的光源技术中获得更高的收入，出于商业原因，对低压钠灯的进一步改进不再感兴趣。",
						"低压钠灯的单色输出使其无法用于所有室内一般照明应用，以及所有需要颜色渲染的户外应用。这几乎将其用途完全限制在主要干线道路的照明上，在这里，高光效通常使其成为最经济的光源——只要维护成本不高到使寿命更长的高压钠灯成为一个更可行的替代品。建筑物周边的安全周界照明是另一个重要应用，其中单色辐射在允许增强视觉检测运动、对比度变化等方面表现出色。由于其辐射是单色的，可以通过单波长滤光片轻松过滤掉，这使得LPS成为减少天文观测点附近光污染的首选光源。通过在分析设备上放置一个窄带宽滤光片，可以从天空辉光中去除钠辐射，同时允许所有其他波长通过。也许它们唯一重要的室内应用是在生产黑白照片的摄影实验室的一般照明中。单色黄色辐射的波长不会导致相纸起雾，允许在工作环境中达到高照明水平。"

						"已经提到过，钠灯发出的光非常接近人眼在正常观看条件下的峰值灵敏度，这一事实解释了它们令人瞩目的高光效。发出的光是单色的，即只包含一种颜色。白炽灯产生从整个可见范围400到700纳米（nm）的所有颜色的光，因此它们具有良好的颜色渲染特性。其他光源在许多不同的离散波长上产生光，并且都提供一定程度的颜色渲染。然而，低压钠光几乎完全由589.0和589.6纳米的深黄色波长组成，无法进行颜色渲染。虽然这在主要道路上不会造成问题，但在城镇中心等其他地区可能无法接受，这也完全排除了将这种光源用于室内照明或任何其他需要颜色渲染的应用。图S5比较了低压钠灯与其他几种常见光源以及日光的光谱功率分布。",
						"传统上，有人认为低压钠光是驾驶时最安全的光源。这是由于其单色输出提高了对比度的感知能力，并允许光线以最小的色散穿透雾和雨。大气中的水分起到了一种棱镜的作用，会将光线分解为其组成颜色，这种现象在自然条件下会形成彩虹时自然出现。SOX光只包含一种颜色，不会像其他光源那样被分散成模糊的多色图像，如图S6所示，因此人眼接收到的图像始终清晰锐利。",
						"这种光不包含蓝色辐射，这种颜色很容易在大气中散射，尤其是在雾和霾中散射得非常厉害——事实上，天空之所以呈现蓝色，是因为这种波长的光在高层大气中被散射，其穿透能力较弱。蓝色光对瞳孔也有不利影响，相对较小量的这种波长会使瞳孔收缩，从而使进入眼睛的光线减少。有时，通过去除蓝色波长的光来增强能见度，因为这样瞳孔会张开得更宽，让更多的光线进入眼睛。由于低压钠光不包含任何蓝色辐射，眼睛在这种光下能够看得非常清楚。\n\t\t此外，我们在单色光下能够更快地感知运动物体与静止物体之间的对比度，这在夜间驾驶中至关重要。图S7显示了一块黑布和白纸一半被低压钠（SOX）灯照亮，另一半被高压钠（SON）型灯照亮时的外观。在SOX光下，黑色显得更黑，简洁地展示了这种光源如何增强对比度。这就是为什么警告标志、路边的箭头等通常印成深黄色和黑色的原因，甚至在自然界中，许多昆虫也采用这种颜色组合，因为与其他颜色组合相比，它更醒目。",
						"低压钠光源的较大物理尺寸可能使光线更难以高效控制，有时向上方天空的眩光问题更严重。尽管如此，天文学家实际上完全赞成这种光源产生的天空辉光。因为这种光是单色的，可以通过去除其单一波长来过滤掉，从而恢复黑暗的天空。没有其他光源能如此轻松地过滤掉夜空中的辉光。出于这个原因，一些拥有重要天文观测点的城市几乎完全将其夜间照明转换为低压钠灯。\n\t\t然而，最近的研究表明，在街道照明中常用的低光强下，人眼并不能完全处于光视状态，其颜色灵敏度会转移到暗视（夜间视觉）条件。因此，图S3中显示的曲线可能并不总是有效，因为其峰值会向光谱的蓝色端移动，如图S8中的虚线所示。这种现象被称为普金斯基位移。这揭示了我们对光的测量单位——流明的一个不足之处，因为它基于人眼在正常日光下的灵敏度曲线。在非常低的光强下，实际上应该用暗视光通量来评价灯具，而不是普遍公布的光视光通量。由于普金斯基位移，低压钠灯在低照度下的效率越来越低。在美国进行的广泛研究表明，在这个国家，街道照明水平比世界其他地区低得多，实际上光谱中含有更多绿蓝色光的光源在这种情况下更有效。然而，世界其他地区的道路照明标准要高得多，普金斯基位移的影响要小得多。",
						"最近没有进行任何关于减少散射、穿透雨/雾、提高对比度或使运动物体更加突出的优势是否被较差的暗视性能所抵消的工作。因此，SOX灯继续用于许多新安装，并且预计这种情况会持续下去，直到收集到更多证据——这可能会完全消灭SOX市场，或者进一步强化其明显的优点！"

						"早期实验表明，对于长正柱放电灯，当钠蒸气压为0.4帕斯卡时，灯的效率最高。这一压力出现在260℃的液态钠上方，如图S9所示。即使温度略有偏离，光输出也会急剧下降，因此很明显，精确控制放电管的温度对于维持高效率至关重要。\n\t\t重要的是要认识到，钠蒸气压仅由放电管中最冷点的温度决定。局部热点并不能提高钠蒸气压，因为金属会优先从这些较热的区域蒸发并在最冷点凝结。换句话说，钠会随着时间迁移到灯的最冷部分，而该区域的温度决定了蒸气压，必须尽可能接近260℃。\n\t\t由于需要一定的能量将放电管加热到这一温度，因此最高效的灯将是用最少的能量输入达到这一温度的灯。正如后面将看到的，许多技术已经结合在一起，生产出一种具有出色隔热性能的灯，它可以用最低的电能输入自我加热到所需温度。"

						"当灯在低电流密度下运行时，即单位体积和放电管长度的功率较低时，效率最高。这就需要一个直径较大、长度较长的放电管。由于钠蒸气对其自身的共振辐射是不透明的，因此放电管的尺寸不能过大，否则核心产生的光将无法到达表面。这将抵消低电流密度带来的好处，而增加自吸收的负面影响。为了实际应用，需要在电流密度和光吸收之间做出妥协。对于每种额定功率的灯，都有一个最佳的放电管直径，但为了实际生产，现代灯已经标准化了两种不同的直径——对于放电电流为0.6A的灯采用较小的直径，对于0.9A类型的灯则采用较大的直径。",
						"幸运的是，自吸收效应并不像听起来那么灾难性，因为低压放电灯中还发生了一种有益的二次过程。在运行过程中，由于自由电子在其表面的积累，放电管的内壁会获得少量负电荷。为了抵消这种电荷不平衡，正钠离子也被吸引到壁上。这一过程称为离子泵送，图S10清晰地展示了这一过程，图中显示了SO/H放电管在启动初期的部分情况。",
						"在这个阶段，钠离子化总量较低，放电主要在惰性气体填充物中进行，很明显钠离子化主要发生在玻璃管的内表面——不管附近是否有钠滴。当灯完全启动后，结果是大部分光不是在放电核心产生的，而是在玻璃表面附近产生的。因此，它只需要通过相对较短的钠蒸气路径，如果没有离子泵送现象，自吸收会更严重。总之，自吸收效应仍然非常重要，但幸运的是，由于离子泵送的好处，这些效应被最小化了。某些线性灯型采用了特别设计的放电管，以进一步减少自吸收造成的损失。",
						"最早的SO/H系列正柱钠灯的隔热性能相对较差，为了使玻璃达到所需的260℃壁温，需要使用非常小直径的管。这限制了灯的效率，因为放电管中的电流密度较高，但为了达到正确的钠蒸气压，这是必要的牺牲。\n\t\t后来钠灯的发展主要集中在提高光效上，这主要是通过改进隔热性能实现的。由此带来的效率提升，并不是因为更好的隔热导致功率损失减少，而是这些改进使得放电管直径可以在保持关键的260℃壁温的同时得以增加。更大的放电管直径是提高灯效率的关键因素，因为这样就可以降低电流密度。\n\t\t这一点从最早的SOI/H灯可以看出，它们的放电管周围直接密封了整体真空夹层。在最初的飞利浦灯中，放电管的尺寸与SO/H前辈基本相同，灯的效率几乎没有提高。这种灯的一个例子可以在这里看到。整体外夹层的提供只是因为灯的机械设计得到了改进。与此同时，在Osram-GEC的发展中，随着向整体外夹层的过渡，放电管直径得以增加，这得益于一对隔热玻璃套管的提供。一个典型的例子可以在这里看到。GEC整体灯的光效比飞利浦整体灯高得多。自然地，在稍后的时间，飞利浦也效仿，对其隔热性能进行了类似的改进，以允许增加放电管直径。\n\t\t1955年Osram-GEC的SOI/H发展使管径增加到了再进一步增加就会因光的自吸收而降低效率的程度。随后，BTH Mazda开展了一些非常创新的工作，他们制造了一系列具有非圆形截面放电管的线性钠灯。这些管径更大的灯以低电流密度提供最佳效率，但它们特殊的形状部分确保玻璃更接近放电，从而使光的传输更加高效。这些独特的光源在“线性钠灯”类别下有详细描述。"

						"在室温下，钠是固态的，灯内没有足够的蒸气来在实际电压下启动。在放电管中填充惰性气体可以显著降低启动电压——如果使用两种或更多惰性气体的混合物，击穿电压可以进一步降低。对于许多惰性气体混合物，存在一个特定比例，混合物的电离势低于其中任何一种单独气体的电离势。这种混合物被称为Penning混合物，以发现这一现象的荷兰飞利浦工程师命名。图S11揭示了180W SOX灯的击穿电压如何随氖气填充中氩气的百分比变化。",
						"图表显示，为了达到最低的击穿电压，灯应该用大约0.25%的氩气和氖气混合。不幸的是，在实际操作中，由于用于放电管的特殊硼酸盐玻璃对氩气有一定的亲和力，无法在这种范围内工作。在灯的使用寿命期间，它会吸附或“清理”一定量的氩气。这必须通过在灯中填充少量多余的氩气来补偿，以确保在整个灯的使用寿命期间保持足够低的击穿电压。通常，大多数灯填充1%的氩气，而18W和10W版本填充1.5%，因为它们的设计是为了在普通扼流圈式镇流器上运行，没有任何启动辅助设备，所以启动更为关键。\n\t\t顺便说一下，了解这种氩气清理现象对于尝试点亮已经闲置多年的老式钠灯非常重要。在灯升温期间，氩气清理速率相对较快，因为这是气体填充被最强烈电离的时期。高能氩离子以更大的力量撞击玻璃壁，其吸附的可能性相当高。如果这样的灯在首次点燃后不久就关闭，那么有可能吸附了足够的氩气，使灯的击穿电压变得如此之高，以至于它再也无法启动。然而，如果玻璃在典型的高温下保持数小时，它将释放大部分吸附的氩气。这种现象只影响20世纪60年代中期之前使用不同玻璃成分制造的老式灯。此外，长期储存的灯在首次启动时特别容易出现加速的氩气吸附。因此，建议在点亮这类灯时，让它们运行数小时，直到达到全运行温度，然后再关闭。一旦玻璃经过这种处理，灯就可以再次安全使用，在未来的使用中，只要不再次闲置多年，就可以使用较短的开关周期。",
						"当使用分子量低的缓冲气体时，灯的效率最高。氦气是与这种灯兼容的分子量最低的气体，但由于它会相对快速地通过玻璃扩散出去，因此无法使用。氖气是次优选择，但它必须与少量较重的氩气结合，以实现上述Penning混合物，并使放电能够在足够低的电压下点燃。\n\t\t当气体填充压力低时，效率也是最高的。这是因为管内的惰性气体原子越少，产生光的钠离子就越不可能与这些原子发生碰撞并失去能量。这种能量损失会产生热量，导致灯的效率降低。最低的氖-氩填充压力似乎是最理想的选择——但正如灯技术中通常的情况一样，并非如此简单，因为气体压力对寿命有很强的影响。",
						"电流通过一对涂有三金属氧化物混合物的电极供应到放电管中，这种混合物是一种电子发射材料。这种发射涂层使电流能够以最小的能量损失注入到放电空间，从而实现良好的灯效率。电极必然运行在高温下，以实现增强的热电子发射，在使用寿命期间，发射涂层会逐渐被蒸发和溅射效应消耗。一旦它消失，灯将开始整流，吸引大电流，这将导致灯头内内置保险丝的熔断，或者如果没有安装保险丝，则会导致电极组件的损坏。\t\t\n\t\t通过简单地增加惰性气体填充的压力来减缓电极发射材料的损失速率，从而延长灯的使用寿命，这是相当简单的。电极周围气体原子浓度的增加有助于防止发射材料原子从电极表面逸出。对于这项任务，分子量高的气体最为有效。相反，如前一节所述，为了实现高灯效率，使用分子量低的填充气体更为理想。\n\t\t因此，在实践中，我们仍然局限于低分子量气体，并且必须考虑增加其填充压力作为一种延长灯寿命的机制。然而，这也有悖于实现高灯效率，因为放电空间中惰性气体原子浓度的增加也会导致钠离子与之发生更频繁的弹性碰撞和非弹性碰撞。这些碰撞带走了它们本可以转化为光的能量。因此，必须在效率和寿命之间达成妥协。考虑到高功率和低功率灯型的其他故障机制不同，导致这两种变体的使用寿命不同，已经确定了不同的填充压力，高功率灯为4-8托，低功率范围为8-12托。",
						"20世纪70年代末，Thorn Lighting在其线性钠灯系列中引入了一种新颖的氖-氩-氙混合物。氙气作为一种较重的原子，自然会减缓电极及其发射涂层的蒸发速率。这使得在给定灯寿命的情况下可以略微降低气体填充压力——正如前面解释的那样，降低压力对于提高灯效率是有利的。然而，有必要尽可能降低氙气的浓度，以避免它与钠离子发生碰撞，从而导致放电中的一些能量损失。",
						"在实践中发现，存在一种最佳浓度，即99%的氖气、0.8%的氩气和0.2%的氙气，这可以略微降低填充压力，并在灯效率和寿命方面带来小但仍然显著的改进。它仅被Thorn用于140W和200W高输出线性钠灯，在这些灯中，它带来的性能提升略大于正常SOX系列中使用的圆形截面放电管。图S12描绘了灯启动前特征惰性气体放电颜色的差异。"

						"在灯的工作温度下，钠在化学上非常活跃。普通玻璃，甚至是石英，也会迅速被染成棕色，从而阻挡光线。这些被染色的区域与未染色材料的膨胀系数不同，膨胀差异可能会导致玻璃破裂。1920年，Arthur H. Compton开发了一种特殊的耐钠玻璃——硼酸盐玻璃。然而，纯硼酸盐玻璃在灯制造中是不令人满意的。它被称为“短玻璃”，意味着它有一个较短的工作温度范围。在加热时，玻璃从刚性状态变为流动性非常快，因此加工起来相当困难。最早的钠灯只能在最熟练的玻璃吹制大师的帮助下制造，他们擅长处理这种玻璃。",
						"通过使用双层玻璃管解决了这个问题。在普通苏打石灰管的内侧吹制一层非常薄（约0.02毫米）的钡铝硼酸盐玻璃。苏打玻璃可以在自动设备上相对容易地加工，并作为硼酸盐衬里的支撑，这种衬里薄到几乎可以忽略不计。这使得耐钠的双层管能够使用标准的玻璃加工方法成型。图S13展示了其一般布置方式。",
						"硼酸盐和苏打石灰玻璃的热膨胀系数并不完全匹配，这可能会由于引入永久性热应力而导致玻璃破裂。双层管的退火时间需要比其他玻璃类型更长。此外，保持硼酸盐涂层厚度在管周长上的均匀性也很重要，以便将径向应力差异最小化。最关键的工序是弯曲管子。在这个过程中，玻璃壁厚自然会在弯曲的外侧变薄，而在内侧变厚。这种效应必须通过在U形模具中正确放置熔体，并在成型前调整玻璃壁厚来最小化。\t\n\t\t如果硼酸盐层的厚度不均匀，钠腐蚀在薄的地方会更严重。这将导致由于玻璃被染色而吸收过多光线或破裂而导致灯早期故障。即使玻璃制造得很好，良好的灯制造工艺也是必要的，因为硼酸盐涂层很容易被损坏。这种玻璃对水分非常敏感，容易受到水分的侵蚀。因此，硼酸盐玻璃通常在加热的卡车中运送到灯厂，并储存在加热的房间中，以防止水分在玻璃中凝结。温度也必须保持恒定，否则会导致管内的空气膨胀和收缩，有在冷却过程中吸入潮湿空气的风险。",
						"硼酸盐玻璃的一个主要缺点是它们倾向于清理氩气，而氩气对于灯的轻松启动和长寿命是必不可少的。经过数十年的发展，已经生产出一种现代玻璃，它具有良好的耐钠性，并且氩气清理率相对较低。尽管这种玻璃尚未完美，但它已经改进到氩气清理率不再是一个限制寿命的因素。关于氩气清理的更多信息可以在前一页找到。",
						"液态钠对硼酸盐玻璃的润湿和粘附对于钠灯工程师来说是另一个相当重要的问题。直到1955年，飞利浦开发了一种新的玻璃类型，其对钠的耐受性有了显著提高，这并不是一个大问题。这种新玻璃在灯的使用寿命期间不会那么快被染色，并且在光通量维持和灯寿命方面都有显著提升。然而，一个显著的缺点是液态钠并没有那么好地粘附在其表面。如果灯没有完全水平地操作，钠会倾向于流向灯的一端，形成大的遮光镜面，而另一端则被耗尽。通过引入所谓的竹节灯，其放电管在长度上频繁地填充，部分解决了这个问题。这些结构足以限制钠在放电管周围的运动。典型的竹节灯可以在这里看到。这是一种相对较短寿命的灯，只由飞利浦制造，并在1958年被改进的玻璃类型所取代，这些玻璃类型在对钠具有良好的化学耐受性的同时，也能更好地使液态金属粘附。"

						"低压钠灯的电极结构与低压汞荧光灯相似，只是稍重一些，以承受更高的放电电流。电极是一个蜂窝状的三重线圈，由黑色钨丝制成，作为空心阴极以降低灯的击穿电压。它涂有一层发射材料，以提高其热电子效率。由于热钠蒸气对玻璃与金属密封处具有攻击性，而这是灯结构中的薄弱环节，因此需要一种特殊的密封设计。图S14展示了一个典型的低压钠电极组件的布置方式。",
						"为了减少将电子流注入放电空间相关的能量损失，从而降低电极附近的温度和热损失，它们被涂上了一层电子发射物质。发射体通常为三碳酸盐型，由钡、锶和钙的碳酸盐混合在有机溶剂中组成。将钨线圈浸入悬浮液中，通过电泳过程将精确量的发射体吸入线圈之间的空间。\n\t\t在灯密封之前，必须通过在真空中电加热阴极来热激活发射体。碳酸盐分解并还原为金属氧化物，在此过程中释放二氧化碳气体。",
						"重要的是不要立即将产生的气体抽出，而是继续激活一小段时间。部分二氧化碳然后与阴极中的钨金属反应生成钨的氧化物，而这种氧化物又与金属氧化物反应生成金属钨酸盐，形成更耐用的发射体。",
						"一旦激活，必须抽出碳质气体，因为它们在成品灯中的存在会导致寿命短、效率低和击穿电压高。然后用纯氖气填充放电管，并在排气机上使用特殊的镇流器（提供比正常开路电压更高的电压）击穿放电。这种离子轰击清洁玻璃和电极组件，释放出进一步的杂质。然后将这些杂质抽出，在从排气机上取下之前，每个放电管接收其剂量的液态钠和最终填充气体。一旦激活，阴极不得暴露在空气或水分中，因为这会毒化它们，可能导致灯提前失效。\n\t\t在灯运行期间，特别是在启动时，一些发射体会从阴极上脱落。当没有发射体时，灯将不容易击穿，这标志着灯的寿命结束。或者，如果一个电极比另一个电极先失去发射体，灯可能会整流（它将交流电源转换为直流电）。在整流期间，大直流电流流动，可能会损坏镇流器的绕组。这就是为什么每个灯的一根外引线较细，如果灯整流，它会熔断，从而保护镇流器。\n\t\t重要的是要确保在阴极上沉积了正确量的发射体。如果太少，它将被快速消耗，灯的寿命将缩短。如果太多，它可能会大片脱落，有一些证据表明这也会缩短灯的寿命，并导致管端提前变黑。发射体涂层应仅覆盖在钨线圈上，不得延伸到夹具下方的镍引线（如果存在）。",
						"电极组件的金属丝被夹封在放电管玻璃中的位置是灯结构中的薄弱环节，如果不对钠采取措施将其与密封处隔离，密封处将受到攻击，导致灯提前失效。\n\t\t第一层保护措施是在每个金属引线的末端封上一段耐钠的硼酸盐玻璃。这里再次使用双层玻璃，但与用于放电管的玻璃不同，这次硼酸盐层位于管的外表面。\n\t\t自然地，这种硼酸盐涂层在玻璃套管区域的长度上提供了良好的保护，但它并没有延伸到套管区域的末端，那里金属丝穿透玻璃。必须将钠与这个暴露区域隔离，发现在这个位置封入一个镁酸盐的小管状珠子特别有效。这已被证明可以完全令人满意地防止液态钠与玻璃-金属密封处接触。在运行期间，这个陶瓷珠子内的温度比灯的其他部分略高，并且在关闭后冷却时间更长。它在这个位置维持的略高温度有助于防止钠在此处凝结。\n\t\t自1985年以来，飞利浦灯采用了一种略有改进的密封方式。它最初用于比利时制造的SOX-E型灯，大约十年后，在所有SOX生产都转移到英国后，扩展到整个系列。在这种结构中，使用纯硼酸盐玻璃套管——它不是双层玻璃管。由于由单一玻璃类型组成，其保护延伸到套管区域的末端，与金属引线接触。因此，不再需要使用镁酸盐珠子。\n\t\t飞利浦密封的另一个有趣的改进是使用铁-镍-钴合金作为引线，而不是竞争对手的SOX以及所有其他在软玻璃中制造的灯中使用的经典铜包镍铁（dumet）丝。这可以略微减少密封泄漏的发生，这是一种罕见的现象，有时会影响具有dumet密封的灯。如果铜包层没有足够好地与镍铁芯钎焊，可能会存在微小的泄漏通道。由于Fe-Ni-Co丝是由单一合金制成的，这种类型的泄漏问题被完全消除。\n\t\t可以通过穿过玻璃的金属丝的颜色来识别这两种密封类型。Dumet灯在低压钠灯中总是呈现出铜色外观，而Fernico型密封则呈现出灰绿色。"

					description: [
						"随着钠灯的使用时间增加，最初的钠分布很少能够保持不变。当钠灯配备有整体真空外灯泡时，沿放电管会形成温度梯度。管端靠近阴极处的功率损失更大，因此这些区域的温度最高。阴极后方的区域因为没有放电而较冷。灯的U形弯端也较冷，因为该区域的隔热效果较差。如果不对这些冷点采取措施，钠会从较热的区域向较冷的区域迁移。\n\t\t可以通过沿管长调整红外涂层的厚度来改善这种情况。涂层在弯处较厚，以提高该处的隔热效果。所有Osram和Thorn/GE（飞利浦采用均匀涂层厚度结合不同的解决方案）生产的灯都采用了分级红外涂层。此外，弯处的管径也很关键。由于该区域的温度较低，通常会在弯处略微收缩。这可以局部增加放电电流密度，提高壁温。\n\t\t最大的问题是钠迁移到电极后方。玻璃管的这一点是钠抗性最弱的地方，化学侵蚀很容易发生。这通常会导致玻璃破裂，是钠灯提前失效的常见原因。因此，钠灯不应倒置运行，因为这会促使钠迁移到电极后方较冷的区域。",
						"如果钠迁移非常严重，导致放电管的一部分耗尽了钠蒸气，那么该点的放电将由惰性气体填充接管。由于惰性气体更难电离，因此该处的灯电流密度会增加，效率开始降低。此外，该区域几乎不发光，进一步降低了效率。如果惰性气体填充压力较低，例如6托（如高功率灯），这部分管子会比其他部分运行得更冷，促使钠迁回到该点，从而解决问题。在低功率灯中，需要更高的气体填充压力（至少8到9托），在这种情况下，钠迁移可能无法自我纠正，因为钠耗尽的放电区域可能会过热，加剧迁移问题。钠可能会全部蒸馏到灯的一端，而在另一端只留下惰性气体放电。这种灯被称为红燃烧灯，偶尔还会在现代路灯安装中看到。\t\n\t\t当一个区域钠不足时，会出现另一个问题——气体填充中的氩气成分被电离。与离子泵送现象吸引钠离子到放电管壁旁的负电荷鞘层一样，氩原子被电离后也是如此。如果它们以足够的力量撞击壁面，它们会嵌入玻璃表面。玻璃对氩气的清理改变了Penning气体混合物，导致灯的击穿电压升高。最终，击穿电压将超过电气控制装置提供的电压，灯将无法启动。这就是灯的寿命结束（气体故障）。",
						"通过将钠均匀分布在放电管中，可以克服其中一些问题，这样就不太可能使某些区域耗尽钠。此外，钠蒸气不容易沿管扩散，因为它必须逆着电流方向移动。因此，每个钠滴主要为其周围区域提供蒸气。因此，将钠滴分布在放电管周围是有益的，这样所有区域都有足够的钠蒸气，并且可以获得更快的启动时间。这就是为什么每盏灯包含的钠比放电中实际所需的蒸气多约50万倍。\n\t\t自1958年以来，飞利浦将钠放置在放电管侧的小凹坑中，这些凹坑自然较冷，有助于保持均匀的钠分布。图S15展示了一个带凹坑的SOX灯。实际上，经过数千小时后，一些钠仍然会从这些凹坑中迁移出来，但它们确实有许多好处。首先，它可以使灯的启动时间加快约50%；其次，它有助于防止在使用寿命期间功率上升，这种现象发生在钠向弯处迁移并耗尽其他区域时。前苏联制造商MELZ也采用了类似的凹坑来制造其灯，但所有凹坑都位于U形弯的一侧，而飞利浦的凹坑则沿着放电管的外周排列。\tOsram-GEC和Thorn在不同时期都制造和销售过带有凹坑的放电管的灯，有时甚至为了试验目的从飞利浦采购整个放电管，但这两家公司都认为凹坑并不足够成功，不足以修改自己的生产。事实上，Osram/GEC和Thorn/GE上的分级红外涂层本身就足以将钠迁移的影响降至最低。由于飞利浦的红外涂层设备无法产生分级的膜厚度，因此凹坑对飞利浦灯更为重要。因此，从平衡的角度来看，凹坑的存在本身不应被视为一种优势——它们只有在无法对红外涂层厚度进行分级时才需要。然而，有一些证据表明，对于老式灯来说，带凹坑的结构的启动速度可能比普通管更快。",
						"唯一完全成功地保持原始钠分布的特殊几何形状是在线性钠灯中。在这里，新月形放电管的“角”向内逐渐变细，毛细作用将液态钠保留在狭窄的通道内。在Thorn的放电管中，其截面呈三叶草形，在每个叶尖处形成了细长的V形凹坑，由于其形状类似于温室屋顶，被亲切地称为“温室”。由于SLI灯的温度分布更均匀，钠倾向于保持在其最初放置的位置。\n\t\t另一种技术，Osram在20世纪50年代末的SOI整体灯中采用，是在隔热套管上定期打孔。其想法是这些局部区域会损失更多的热量，略微较冷的壁面可能会保留一些钠。这个想法并不成功，但出于历史兴趣，这种试验灯的一个例子可以在这里看到。"

						"有四种主要的失效机制决定了现代低压钠灯的寿命，按重要性顺序详细说明如下：电极寿命结束 发射涂层耗尽。气体寿命结束 气体填充中的氩气被消耗。整流 可能由电极故障引起。提前失效 由破裂、电解效应等引起。",
						"这是大多数SOX灯达到其寿命终点的机制。简单来说，当电极表面的所有发射涂层都被消耗掉，放电所需的电压超过了控制装置能够提供的电压时，就会发生这种情况。在生产过程中，每个电极上施加的发射体数量主要决定了达到这一条件之前经过的确切时间。显然，不可能在每个电极上精确地获取相同的发射体重量，发射体重量的自然变化导致了灯寿命的变化。开关频率在这里也起着重要作用。SOX灯的设计是每24小时开关一次。由于在启动时电极上的负荷非常高，导致大量电极材料被溅射掉，因此这种情况发生的频率越高，灯的寿命就越短。",
						"必须用于制造SOX放电管的硼酸盐玻璃的一个缺点是，它们倾向于对氩离子有很高的亲和力。大多数SOX灯在氖气填充中使用1%到1.5%的氩气，这大大降低了击穿放电所需的电压到合理的水平。然而，在整个灯的使用寿命期间，玻璃会吸收少量的氩气。在某些灯中，特别是高功率类型，尤其是180W灯，可能会出现氩气填充在电极达到其使用寿命之前就被消耗完的情况。在不保持均匀钠分布的灯中，这个问题也更为明显。在钠耗尽的区域，氖-氩气体填充被电离得更多，在这些条件下，氩气吸收的速率加快。当击穿放电所需的电压超过镇流器的开路电压时，灯就会“失效”。",
						"这是一种灯开始像整流器一样工作，将供给的交流电流转换为直流电流的过程。灯可能会因为一个电极相对于另一个电极的电子发射特性发生变化而开始这样做。最常见的情况是，一个电极比另一个电极先耗尽其发射涂层。然而，如果钠金属与一个电极或其引线接触，也会发生同样的效果——这也是引线被玻璃套管包裹的另一个原因，以尽量减少与液态钠的接触。一旦开始整流，灯和镇流器绕组中将流动比正常情况下更高的电流。在早期的灯设计中，高电流整流可能会持续数小时。在这个过程中，由于通过的高电流，镇流器的温度升高，这可能导致绕组之间的绝缘层被击穿，从而再次允许更高的电流流动。最终，镇流器会在如此高的负荷下烧毁。现在的所有现代灯都在灯头内配备了一根可熔的蒙乃尔合金丝，如果发生整流，它就会熔断，从而避免了镇流器不可避免的损坏。",
						"这可能是最麻烦的一种故障，因为它无法预测，并且在灯的使用寿命早期就会发生。一般来说，提前失效是由于制造缺陷造成的，直到最近，这些缺陷还很难消除。不同的制造商的精确失效机制往往不同，这代表了他们采用的不同生产技术。电解效应或许可以解释大多数提前失效的情况。这些效应是由于在玻璃部件上建立了一个高电场，这可能导致玻璃分解和破裂。或者，由于放电管内的钠被电离，如果存在足够强的电场，它很容易被吸入玻璃并将其破裂。这些电场的形成几乎都可以追溯到外灯泡上的钡吸气剂的存在。由于这种薄膜具有导电性，如果它与任何内部导线接触，那么在钡沉积的玻璃基底和穿过玻璃的任何导线之间就会建立一个电场。玻璃会分解并破裂，导致漏气。这种情况既可能发生在放电管的夹封处，也可能发生在外灯泡的夹封处。如果红外反射涂层与钡吸气剂接触，它也会带电，因为它是一个良好的导电体。然后，如果放电管在U形弯处的顶部支撑是由金属制成的，并且接触到放电管，它可以在U形弯和封顶区域建立一个电场。钠可以在这里被吸入玻璃，最终可能导致破裂和放电管泄漏。所有这些效应都在飞利浦最近推出的新型SOX PSG灯中被消除。由于钡吸气剂涂层被固体吸气剂颗粒取代，以前有时会在一些玻璃部件上出现的电场不再存在。因此，在这种新型灯设计中，避免了绝大多数提前失效，其使用寿命仅由电极和气体寿命决定。因此，SOX PSG灯在维护方面节省了相当大的成本，因为理论上在灯的使用寿命的前6000小时内，不需要进行任何局部更换。"

						"钠蒸汽灯的起源可以追溯到1919年美国西屋电气公司的Arthur H. Compton获得的一项专利。这是第一个发出特征性深黄色钠共振线的光源（Compton, 1919）。汞灯已经存在了近二十年，但钠也成为制造蒸汽灯的合理材料，仅仅因为它具有相对较高的蒸汽压。Compton指出，钠放电的发光效率异常高，超过200lm/W，尽管这个数字没有包括将灯加热到工作温度所需的功率（Compton和van Voorhis, 1923）。\n\t\t在这个阶段，有必要解释一下“效率”这个术语——它是总光输出（流明）与输入功率（瓦特）的比率。单位是每瓦流明，lm/W。作为比较，白炽灯泡的效率约为13 lm/W。相比之下，效率指的是以瓦特为单位发出的光的绝对功率，表示为灯的瓦特消耗的比率。效率没有考虑人眼对不同颜色光的敏感度变化，而流明则考虑了，因此对于照明工程师来说，效率是一个更有用的术语。",
						"尽管Compton的灯效率很高，但由于加热的钠具有高度腐蚀性，无法商业化。当时没有可用的玻璃可以在不迅速恶化的前提下容纳放电。因此，西屋电气指示Compton创造一个合适的容器，第二年他获得了一种硼酸盐玻璃的专利，这种玻璃对钠蒸汽的抵抗力大大增强（Compton, 1920）。\n\t\t1920年，Compton基于这种玻璃制造了第一个成功的钠蒸汽灯，其外观如图S16所示。它由一段硼酸盐玻璃管组成，其中心被吹制成近似球形，两端的放电容器中密封了螺旋形的钨电极。电极被加热到白炽温度，随后发生热电子发射，它们形成了良好的阴极，然后可以在间隙之间击穿放电。电极之间的距离相对较短，因此灯的运行电压较低，需要高电流才能提供足够的光。",
						"直到1930年，M. Pirani开始在德国Osram公司进行钠放电实验，才取得了重大进展。他制造了一系列低压高电流的管状灯，这些灯在烤箱中运行，以将钠蒸发到所需的压力。在充满氪气的管中，钠蒸汽压力为10Pa时，测量到的放电效率高达350lm/W（同样不包括烤箱为加热灯提供的功率）。在Pirani的工作之后，第一个实用的钠光源被创造出来。在柏林Osram建筑的一个内庭院进行了试验之后，他在1931年8月点亮了外面的一条街道。一个围绕放电管的玻璃套筒起到了一些粗糙的热绝缘作用，以保持放电足够热，从而蒸发足够的钠，这些灯的效率约为每瓦46流明。",
						"第一个开始制造钠灯的公司是飞利浦，最早的商业应用是在1932年6月28日使用“Philora”灯。在荷兰的Beek和Geleen之间的路段安装了30个直流灯，图S17展示了所使用的灯的类型。它们在15V 5.5A下运行，达到了38.5lm/W的系统效率（包括变压器损耗和电极加热电流）。一个单中心阴极安装在大直径玻璃泡的中心，阴极涂有碱土金属氧化物，以实现良好的电子发射。放电被击穿到位于放电容器两端的一对阳极环，这些阳极环位于中心阴极两侧约2厘米处，整个组件被封装在一个可拆卸的杜瓦夹套中，以维持灯的高工作温度。由于发现当从交流电源驱动时，灯的寿命短得令人无法接受，因此灯必须在直流电路中运行（Dorgelo和Bouma, 1937）。这是因为，在直流电下，钠保持在灯泡中心的阴极周围，而在交流电下，当它们处于阴极部分的周期时，钠可以迁移到管端，然后钠会攻击管端的玻璃密封处。",
						"继飞利浦开发直流灯之后，美国通用电气公司迅速将设计改为交流电操作，其著名的10000流明“NA-9”钠灯于1936年投放市场（图S18）。它在放电容器的两端都有一个氧化物涂层的加热电极（Buttolph, 1939），并且在美国一直生产到1966年，没有变化。在启动之前，阴极需要2-3V的10A激励电流，以达到热电子发射温度，然后机械继电器将整个开路电压施加到管上，电弧在基本上纯氖气中被击穿。灯以串联方式运行，放电电流限制为6.6A，电压为50V，在30分钟内随着温度升高而降至30V。每盏灯的总功率为180W。通用电气还生产了一个较小的145W 6000流明的型号，称为NA-10，尽管这个型号从未流行起来。此外，还有一个小型的65W NA-1灯，其放电管非常小，旨在作为实验室的单色辐射源。\n\t\t与同时在欧洲进行的发展相比，通用电气的努力相对效率较低，寿命较短（3000小时），但通用电气仍然将这种过时的设计推向市场，直到公司完善了其高压钠光源。值得注意的是，为了规避与钠灯所需的硼酸盐玻璃相关的专利，通用电气为其NA系列光源开发了一种不同的方法来保护玻璃。首先将较大的放电容器从普通的硼硅酸盐玻璃制成，像当时的汞弧管一样吹入模具，然后用一种溶液填充，排干后在灯泡内表面留下一层沉积物。经过高温烧制过程，一层富含硼酸盐的层与灯泡内表面融合。这种玻璃成分没有被竞争对手的专利覆盖，因为这种玻璃是不可加工的（即它不能像其他玻璃一样被加热和成型）。\t\n\t\t就像飞利浦的设计一样，整个放电管在杜瓦夹套内运行，以提供热绝缘，在封闭颈部区域的盖子周围有一堆软石棉环，以防止对流热损失。",
						"飞利浦和通用电气的低压钠灯都是按照当时白炽灯的类似方式制造的——因此形成了一个玻璃茎组件，其中引入导线被密封在一个玻璃管中，玻璃管的一端被向外展开。然后将展开部分的边缘与玻璃灯泡的开口颈部融合，将两部分密封在一起，形成图S18a所示的结构。这造成了一个问题，因为颈部区域远离放电的热量，钠会倾向于在此处凝结，永远无法变得足够热以蒸发进入放电。当然，缩短颈部区域并将茎进一步插入灯泡是可行的，但这导致玻璃与金属的密封更接近放电，以更高的温度运行。即使是最好的硼酸盐玻璃也会迅速腐蚀，密封处会开裂。这个问题通过两种不同的方法得到了解决——图S18b是飞利浦的最终解决方案，而通用电气采用了图S18c的设计。\n\t\t飞利浦率先引入了所谓的“反向捏封”，在灯泡的外部进行围绕引入导线的捏封。因此，玻璃与金属的密封保持在足够低的温度以确保可靠性，但足够温暖以防止钠凝结。\n\t\t通用电气的首选方法是飞利浦早期放弃的一种发展，继续采用茎密封设计，但将颈部与灯泡部分隔离。要么是铬铁板，要么是云母板将这两个区域分开，导线穿过并用非硅酸盐陶瓷浆料固定到位。一个小玻璃管或陶瓷管也穿过圆盘，这是为了在制造过程中抽空灯的下部体积所必需的，但管子非常细，以至于在灯相对较短的使用寿命内，几乎不会有钠通过进入颈部空间，从而将具有攻击性的填充物远离脆弱的玻璃与金属密封。"

						"飞利浦很快意识到，由交流电驱动、从细长的正柱放电中产生光的灯，比之前的短弧低压灯要高效得多，因为钠灯的效率随着放电中电流密度的降低而增加。因此，需要一个长管，而随着电极之间间隙的增加，这必然需要在灯上施加高电压。高电压还有一个额外的优势，即灯不再需要在市电供应中以长串联链的形式运行，每个灯都可以独立于安装中的其他灯连接。\n\t\t对于高压灯来说，交流电是绝对必要的，因为由于放电管的长度很长，如果使用直流电运行，钠会在短时间内全部被吸引到阴极端。在前一页讨论的直流灯中，这不是一个问题，因为阴极位于一个大灯泡的中心，它有助于将钠保持在放电的核心位置。\n\t\t在最初的设计中，再次由飞利浦开创，长放电管被双折叠成四个平行部分，以实现与早期直流产品相似的紧凑性，并且它在可拆卸的杜瓦夹套内运行，以最大化其效率。氧化物涂层电极被密封在管的两端，类似于当时用于白炽灯的灯脚组件。灯脚的四个引脚为管两端的阴极提供电流，以便在启动放电之前对它们进行预热，并且持续保持加热电流，以确保电极足够温暖以高效运行。第五个中央引脚连接到放电管上部支撑，作为外部辅助电极以帮助点燃。这种风格的灯在1932年底英国克罗伊登的普利路首次推出。它被称为Philora“DA”灯，额定功率为100瓦，电流为0.6安培，提供了一个显著提高的光效，达到62流明/瓦。DA名称意味着具有A型电极（需要外部加热电流）的双折叠放电类型。",
						"很快发现，由于灯上的高电压，实际上电极处辐射出足够的功率，使它们自身保持温暖，并且足够坚固，可以进行冷启动。1932年晚些时候，上面所示的灯迅速演变为具有大E40螺纹底座的简化结构，一个端子连接到放电管的每一端。当然，消除阴极加热电流也使控制装置大大缩小，并简化了布线安排。-这些灯被称为DO型-具有双折叠放电管和O型电极（这些电极是氧化物涂层的，不需要外部加热）。这种结构的灯如图S20所示。",
						"这两种设计都存在时间不长，在1932年结束之前，当灯被重新设计成在杜瓦夹套内运行的普通U形放电管时，效率再次提高。尽管这种灯没有那么紧凑，但它有优势，因为钠蒸气会吸收自己的辐射，在DA灯中，由于一管的光被其邻居吸收，一些光丢失了。因此，新的排列方式使光效提高了几个百分点，并且推出了一系列不同功率的灯。它们的额定功率为50瓦、65瓦和100瓦，用于0.6安培的电流运行，以及150瓦的型号用于0.9安培的运行。SO/H名称就是在这个时候创造的，这些灯为几乎所有未来的低压钠发展设定了标准。"

						"1932年，第一批U形正柱灯投放市场，这一年非常繁忙，有三代钠灯被推出并迅速被取代！它们被称为SO/H型，SO表示钠蒸气，/H意味着灯必须水平燃烧。这一年首次放弃了昂贵且难以加工的固体硼酸盐玻璃，取而代之的是普通苏打石灰玻璃管，其内表面吹制了一层薄薄的硼酸盐。管子被弯成U形，并使用飞利浦为其直流灯发明的反向捏封密封方式，将氧化物涂层电极密封在管的两端。引线被焊接到瓷质卡口底座的接触点上，一个搪瓷铁叉为U形管提供机械支撑，并将弯曲部分定位在杜瓦夹套内侧的凹槽中。叉子与一个电极电连接，并作为第三个辅助外部电极，以促进放电的点燃。\n\t\t如果放电管在自由空气中运行，热损失将阻止它变得足够热以汽化钠，结果灯将无法正常运行。为了在不提供外部加热器的情况下达到最佳温度260°C，需要某种形式的热绝缘。绝缘效果最好的灯效率最高，因为保持其温暖所需的功率更少。放电管通过传导、对流和辐射失去热量，理想的灯应尽量减少这三种损失机制。\n\t\t通过相对简单的方法大大减少了传导和对流损失——放电管被安装在一个单独的、可拆卸的杜瓦真空夹套内。由于热量不能在夹套内的真空空间中传导或对流，因此得以保留。其原理与我们使用保温瓶（如真空瓶）来保持咖啡温暖时相同。然而，SO/H对辐射热的损失几乎没有起到什么作用，放电管向其周围的空气空间的传导和对流损失阻止了效率的进一步提高。图S21以示意图形式展示了SO/H灯，一些示例已被拍摄，可以从本网站的主页查看其详细信息。",
						"飞利浦在1932年首次推出SO/H灯，有四种功率，具体细节可在下表S1中找到。所有灯的额定使用寿命均为2500小时（Dorgelo和Bouma，1937）。未说明这些数据是适用于100小时值还是平均使用寿命表现，但前者似乎是这一时期灯的常见数据。",
						"1937年后不久，制造出了一种新的玻璃，其氩气吸附率降低，此后可以生产出含有较少这种降低效率气体的灯。新的气体填充使灯的效率略有提高，灯被重新额定为较低的功率，以保持每种尺寸的大致相同光通量。新重新额定的SO/H灯的数据在表S2中引用，这些是100小时值（飞利浦英国目录，1943）。",
						"所有杜瓦夹套灯的一个主要问题是，在关闭后冷却时，放电管周围的空气收缩，从而从外部吸入冷空气。这常常会将灰尘带入灯内，逐渐积聚并吸收光线。此外，如果吸入了水分，就会形成冷凝膜，而且由于水是电的导体，湿润的灯在寒冷季节的晚上往往很难点燃。在早期，公共照明工程师会在潮湿的晚上走上街头，手动开关有问题的灯具，希望在几次尝试后能够点燃。\n\t\tBTH-Mazda是唯一一家解决这些问题的公司，其灯具多年来一直是受青睐的品牌。在灯的U形弯曲处附有两个硅胶小袋，用于吸收水分，在85W规格的灯中，由于其管子细长，启动最为困难，玻璃还涂有一层防水的硅酮膜。在某个时期，该公司还在85W灯的气体填充中加入了一定量的氙气，因为这一规格对玻璃的电气负荷最高，玻璃对氩气的吸附导致灯提前失效。最初由Osram-GEC发现，氙气不会被玻璃吸收，BTH 85W灯的使用寿命显著延长，尽管氙气的高原子量确实导致光通量损失了约12%。\n\t\t1955年，飞利浦引入了一种新的玻璃，其对钠腐蚀的抵抗力显著增强。然而，一个缺点是，液态钠对其表面的附着力相当差，如果不保持绝对水平，它会围绕灯流动，形成大的遮光镜面。尽管由于玻璃变色减少，其改善了光通量维持数据，但由于钠镜的形成，这在很大程度上被抵消了。为了解决这个问题，飞利浦发明了所谓的“竹节”灯，Osram-GEC也在几年后非常短暂地制造了这种灯。玻璃在几个点被加工成凹槽，使其看起来像竹竿，凹槽成功地防止了液态钠围绕灯流动（图S22）。",
						"然而，这种新玻璃还有另一个缺点，那就是它比以前的成分吸收氩气的速度要快得多，会迅速变色。为了获得有用的灯寿命，此时将稀有气体填充改为氖 - 氙 - 氦混合物。消除氩气虽然增加了灯的寿命，但新气体由于增加了弹性碰撞和非弹性碰撞而降低了灯的效率。然而，这只是影响新灯的代价。在使用寿命内，由于新玻璃的光透过率更高，且不会迅速变色，这一问题得到了更大的补偿。140W型号的灯效率从76提高到84流明/瓦。\n\t\t与此同时，BTH Mazda建立了自己的钠抗性硬玻璃生产，这标志着该公司的一个重要进步。它制造的双层硼硅酸盐玻璃管在化学上是稳定的，同时对液态钠有良好的附着力，且氩气清洁率相对较低。因此，除了上面提到的85W规格外，其灯可以在稍高的效率下运行 - 140W规格的灯效率可达87流明/瓦。此外，事实上这也是开发这种硬玻璃的主要原因，它比飞利浦/欧司朗的软玻璃具有更低的热膨胀系数，在生产和使用中几乎完全消除了开裂现象。然而，使用这种玻璃的成本很高，一旦开发出改进的软玻璃，生产就恢复到了这种风格，并接受了与软玻璃相关的通常更高的生产废品率。\n\t\t1958年，通过在制造过程中用过量的氩气处理玻璃，解决了新软玻璃的氩气清洁问题，那一年飞利浦和欧司朗钠灯的效率从84提高，并达到了BTH的87流明/瓦，因为它们也可以重新采用以前的氖/氩气体填充。\n\t\t大约在同一时间，飞利浦率先在放电管的侧面引入小凹槽，形成了冷点，作为钠的储存库，以固定钠的位置。这比竹节灯和早期灯有了显著的改进，因为凹槽是冷点，减缓了钠向U形弯曲处的蒸馏速度。在使用寿命内保持了更好的钠蒸气分布，因此光通量维持得到了极大的改善。竹节灯在使用寿命结束时，光通量维持通常会下降到60-65%，而凹槽灯达到了75-80%。凹槽的另一个优点是，钠集中在厚度更大、直径更小的球体中。这在减少早期灯中由钠镜引起的遮光效果方面发挥了积极作用，并使光通量提高了约3.5%。\n\t\t由于暴露的凹槽很易碎，它们只在SO/H可拆卸灯中短暂使用。在插入杜瓦夹套时，很容易刮伤玻璃表面。此外，杜瓦夹套内壁的直径被设定为容纳普通放电管 - 但凹槽更接近杜瓦夹套的壁，如果不能完美对齐，振动可能会导致内壁与杜瓦夹套相撞，从而导致凹槽破裂。一些参考文献称，它们早在1956年就被引入，但在SO/H型灯上推出后很快就被撤回，生产恢复到早期的竹节设计，因为破裂率太高。在1958年飞利浦推出其第一款一体式灯（在下一部分中介绍）之后，凹槽又重新出现。然而，其他参考文献称，凹槽直到1958年才首次在杜瓦夹套灯上引入，并且在同一年，钠灯的生产直接升级为一体式设计。"

						"为了解决之前提到的SO/H灯的一些缺点，欧司朗-通用电气于1955年发明并投放市场一系列所谓的“一体式”SOI/H灯。此前一直伴随所有低压钠灯的杜瓦夹套被取消，取而代之的是一个一件式的密封抽真空外罩，将放电管包裹其中。这一设计旨在减少放电管与杜瓦夹套内壁之间的热传导和对流损失，从而提高灯的效率。\n\t\t然而，与普遍观点相反，这一改变实际上对热绝缘的改善作用甚微，并未带来初始灯效率的显著提高。杜瓦夹套的性能如此之好，尽管放电管确实向其周围的空气散发了一些热量，但整个系统很快达到平衡，经过几十分钟后，就不再有进一步的显著热损失。实际上，正如前面关于钠迁移的部分所解释的那样，这层空气相当有利，而用真空取代它带来了一个新的重大问题。尽管如此，一体式外罩通过大幅降低灯在使用寿命内的光通量衰减率，证明了其存在的价值，因为它消除了灰尘逐渐进入灯内的问题。同时，也防止了在放电管表面形成令人烦恼的导电性水分膜，从而使灯的点燃更加可靠。最后，这种设计当然也带来了一个更紧凑、更便宜、更轻便的产品，具有商业优势。图S24展示了一个早期的细长型一体式灯。",
						"此前，钠灯的热绝缘改进只集中在减少传导和对流热损失上。1956年，欧司朗-通用电气着手解决辐射热损失问题，它在其140W灯的放电管的每一肢周围放置了一个普通玻璃套管——1958年，较低功率的灯也接受了同样的处理。本页的图S23a展示了这种灯的端视图。玻璃套管将大约一半的辐射热反射回放电管，同时只吸收大约3%的光线。关键的影响是，管壁温度升高，因此，为了将其恢复到最佳的260°C水平，必须增大管径。这导致放电管内的电流密度相应下降，而前面已经解释过，钠灯在较低的放电电流密度下运行效率最高。\n\t\t通用电气引入的大口径放电管，将140W灯的效率提高到了前所未有的93流明/瓦的新高度。典型SOI/H灯的规格可以在下表S3中找到（飞利浦英国目录，1965年和《光与照明》第248页）。此时，新的200W和300W灯也加入了低压钠灯系列。外罩直径必然需要重新增大到SO/H灯最初使用的尺寸，以容纳宽口径放电管和额外的玻璃绝缘套管。",
						"欧司朗对宽口径玻璃套管设计的专利，阻止了竞争对手直接抄袭。然而，飞利浦通过在放电管的两肢周围安装一个单一的大直径反光套管，绕过了专利。这比以前的杜瓦式灯有所改进，但其隔热效果不如欧司朗的灯好。无法采用大口径放电管，因此其灯的效率也不如高。试验了双层和三层套管的使用，但由于随着套管数量的增加，吸收的光线也越多，而且到了一定程度，尽管热绝缘更好，效率又开始下降，因此生产中最多只使用了两层。图S25详细展示了飞利浦结构的端视图。BTH Mazda在一体式灯的生产中毫无作为，因为该公司当时决定将全部精力集中在一个新概念上，即线性钠灯，它比这两种一体式发展都具有更多的优势。",
						"不幸的是，一体式设计带来了钠迁移这一新问题，两家公司的灯都存在这一问题。放电管周围的真空无法像SO/H放电管周围的湍流空气那样，沿其长度提供均匀的温度分布。由于电极前方的功率损耗，灯的电极端总是比弯曲端略热，因此钠沿着从热区到冷区的温度梯度迁移（实际上是被蒸馏）。它在U形弯曲处附近积聚，较热的区域钠蒸气耗尽，这些区域的放电可能会恢复到纯氖放电。氖放电产生的热量比钠放电多，这进一步加热了已经钠耗尽的区域，从而加剧了问题。\n\t\t为了抵消钠向U形弯曲处迁移的趋势，在许多SOI灯中可以看到，玻璃在此处被收缩，使其更接近放电并提高管壁温度。在某些飞利浦灯中，相反，在弯曲处的外部涂了一层反光的铂漆。这两种技术在提高弯曲温度以减少迁移影响方面都取得了部分成功。然而，直到开发出红外涂层的SOX型灯，钠迁移问题才得到有效解决。\n\t\t必须解决的另一个设计特点是，在SO灯中，由支撑放电管并作为第三个辅助电极的长搪瓷金属叉来协助点燃。SOI不需要这种支撑，但为了确保可靠的点燃，通用电气用一对镍丝取代了它，镍丝缠绕在U形管的每一肢上，并与相邻肢的阴极相连。这种设计再次受到公司专利的保护，而飞利浦则使用了一段短的搪瓷电线，它只沿着放电管的一肢运行几厘米。图S26展示了最终应用于欧司朗-通用电气和飞利浦SOI风格的量产灯中的结构。",
						"在灯的外罩中实现高真空并不容易，一旦获得，保持真空就更加困难，因为内部部件会随着时间的推移继续释放气体。这就是为什么在所有一体式钠灯的外罩中都使用化学“吸气剂”的原因。这不仅有助于最初实现所需的真空，而且还能在整个灯的使用寿命内保持真空。钠灯使用钡吸气剂，它由外罩内壁（通常在灯头附近，不影响光输出）上的一层该金属镜面组成。钡是一种高活性金属，能从灯内的气氛中化学去除许多杂质气体。镜面的消失或变色意味着外罩不再具有所需的真空。图S27展示了灯的效率如何随外罩真空质量的变化而变化。"

						"在SOI/H灯中使用玻璃套管来最小化辐射损失的技术并不是一个特别有效的解决方案，因为每个套管只能将大约一半的辐射热重新引导回放电管。在20世纪60年代，低压钠灯研究的主要焦点是寻找能够更有效地捕获红外波长的新材料，同时对光保持透明。\n\t\t最早的发展采用了应用于外罩的纯金属涂层。这些涂层形成了出色的红外反射器，但带来了吸收它们帮助产生的额外光线的大部分的缺点。最终发现，某些金属氧化物涂层具有所需的高红外反射和高可见光透射的特性。红外涂层的加热效果允许降低灯的功率，同时保持放电管在最佳温度。放电管中随后的电流密度降低则负责提高光效。\n\t\t为了说明红外涂层在使放电管达到正确工作温度方面的重要性，图S28中展示的演示灯已经特别制作（感谢苏格兰汉密尔顿飞利浦照明工厂）。外罩的一半涂有正常的氧化铟锡红外膜，而另一半经过化学蚀刻以去除涂层并恢复为透明玻璃。在正常条件下运行一段时间后，很明显，灯的左侧已经完全运行起来，而右侧的温度要低得多，导致只有少量的钠离子化。",
						"顺便说一下，灯的未涂层区域太热而无法触摸，而涂层区域则相对凉爽，这表明没有涂层时热损失当然要大得多。红外涂层令人印象深刻的热绝缘效果在图S29中同一灯的热像图中得以揭示。这表明，涂层区域的玻璃表面温度约为60°C，而在未涂层区域，温度超过100°C。",
						"第一个采用薄膜热反射器的商业灯是由欧司朗-通用电气制造的60瓦线性钠灯，它在外罩内侧涂有一层15纳米厚的纯金膜。出于显而易见的原因，它在几年内以“GEC金色线性”为商标名进行销售。相同的涂层也应用于该公司的160瓦和200瓦线性钠灯，在这些灯中，金将大量热量反射回放电管，允许其直径增大，从而降低放电电流密度并提高光效。然而，金膜吸收了它帮助产生的额外光线的相当一部分。如果将其作为整个灯的完整涂层应用，它将极大地提高放电效率，但由于吸收了太多光线，实际上总灯效率会降低。由于金膜吸收的光线比它产生的额外光线还要多，因此金膜对于U形灯并不实用，但由于线性钠灯的一个独特特性（在下一节中介绍），它们适用于该设计。线性钠放电管的横截面不是圆形的，它在一个平面上比另一个平面发出更多的光。通过以两条宽条的形式应用金涂层，可以将放电管的平面排列，使其辐射最多光的表面与外罩中的一条清晰条纹对齐，以实现良好的透射。金膜仅应用于放电管较不发光的两侧。通过在金上应用一层辅助的抗反射硫化锌膜，可以获得约30%的额外光透射，但由于成本过高，无法应用于商业灯设计。\n\t\t德国欧司朗也曾非常短暂地制造过175瓦和220瓦的线性钠灯——这些灯采用了铋膜，以规避欧司朗-通用电气对金使用专利的限制，由于效率稍低，它们的功率比通用电气的160瓦和200瓦同类产品高，以获得相当的光通量。",
						"随着金属氧化物半导体膜的使用，进一步的改进得以实现，飞利浦在传统的U形管一体式灯上开创了这种膜的使用。首先使用的材料是氧化锡，它具有非常高的光透射率，同时仍然是一个出色的红外反射器。因此，它可以应用于灯外罩的整个表面，对可见光的吸收最小。1964年，这种新型超高效半导体涂层灯投放市场，SOX名称也在那时引入。SOX灯以40瓦、60瓦、100瓦和150瓦的功率推出，取代了以前的60瓦、85瓦、140瓦和200瓦玻璃套管SOI型号，其规格详细列于表S4（飞利浦英国灯目录，1966年）。奇怪的是，出于未知原因，最小的45瓦SOI灯没有SOX替代品。\n\t\t由于涂层厚度沿管的长度相当均匀，因此必须使用钠保持凹槽，以防止钠沿灯迁移。欧司朗-通用电气迅速模仿飞利浦的发展，并制造了自己的氧化锡涂层SOX灯系列。这些在技术上与飞利浦型号相似，也采用了凹槽放电管。欧司朗-通用电气毫不拖延地将其相同的涂层应用于其60瓦、160瓦和200瓦线性钠产品，取代了以前的金金属涂层。同年接管AEI Mazda的Thorn Lighting也开始在其线性钠系列中使用氧化锡膜，该系列提供60瓦和200瓦的额定功率。",
						"两年后的1966年，飞利浦开发了一种改进的掺锡氧化铟涂层，这种涂层提供了更高的钠黄光透射率。这些似乎从1968年开始上市。由于它们的效率更高，SOX系列被重新额定为新的较低功率，具有大约相同的光通量。灯的功率降低到35瓦、55瓦、90瓦、135瓦和180瓦。重新额定的SOX的技术规格列于表S5。请注意，由于涂层允许的效率提高，还引入了新的较小的18瓦和10瓦光源。",
						"此时，Thorn提供了一种部分基于改进涂层的200瓦高输出线性钠灯，它在不增加额外功耗的情况下提供了比旧设计多10%的光。铟膜还被用于1966年引入的一种新的140瓦额定功率。60瓦和标准200瓦产品继续使用早期的氧化锡膜，直到这些产品在1985年过时。\n\t\t掺锡氧化铟膜是当今SOX灯上仍然使用的标准涂层材料。需要锡是因为它增加了膜中的自由电荷载流子数量，使其成为一个比纯氧化铟更好的热反射器。图S30说明了这种膜的透射率和反射率如何随波长变化。对于钠光（约589纳米），透射率很高，因此大约90%产生的光可以通过外罩。放电管辐射的大部分红外线在约5500纳米处，图表显示这种波长的反射率很高，因此涂层是一个非常有效的热反射器。\n\t\t通过增加膜的厚度可以实现更好的红外反射，但较厚的膜也透射较少的光，降低了效率。在红外反射和可见光透射之间选择了折中方案，以实现最大效率。这相当于膜厚度约为0.32微米。这种涂层通常使涂层表面反射的光线呈现绿色。早期的氧化锡灯可以通过表面反射在线性风格中呈现黄色，在U形管风格中呈现橙色来区分。",
						"SOX-E（经济型）灯与标准型号类似，但具有更好的热绝缘，因此效率更高。通过在特殊的SOX-E控制装置上运行它们，可以进一步提高效率，该装置在最佳（较低）电流负载下运行灯，对于低功率型号为0.3安培，对于较大灯为0.6安培。在这些条件下，灯的效率可以高达200流明/瓦，但当然，由于以较低电流运行，相同尺寸灯的总光输出会降低。SOX-E系列的技术规格详细列于下表S6。",
						"目前还不实用将红外涂层应用于外罩的圆顶端，因此在标准SOX灯中，热量通过这个透明玻璃的“窗口”散失。E灯在灯的圆顶端有额外的绝缘，这可能是一个高反射金属圆盘，或者是一个夹在外罩弯曲部分外面的热反射帽。随着热损失的减少，灯的效率提高。飞利浦和欧司朗制造的E灯上的红外涂层也略胜一筹，通常它们的表面反射的光线呈现红色调。\n\t\t在图S31中是一张氧化锡灯、氧化铟灯和改进的氧化铟SOX-E灯的照片。这些涂层反射的光线颜色可以分别看到是橙色、绿色和粉红色。"

						"在设计高效低压钠灯时，必须优化六个关键参数，以提供性能最佳的灯具。这些参数如下：放电管的工作温度接近260°C。优秀的热绝缘性能。低放电电流密度。放电管的表面积与体积比大。低惰性气体填充压力。高效的电极设计。",
						"虽然每个标准单独实现起来相对容易，但它们之间存在一些冲突。最显著的是，既需要低电流密度，又需要大的表面积与体积比。\n\t\t低电流密度要求使用大直径的长放电管，这也解释了低压钠灯较大的物理尺寸。然而，对于具有大表面积与体积比的放电管，效率也会提高。原因是钠蒸气对其自身的黄色共振辐射是不透明的，即它会吸收自身的光。如果使用大直径放电管，虽然光生成效率很高，但由于大部分在放电管核心产生的光在逃逸之前被吸收，因此光提取效率较低。\n\t\t在实际的灯设计中，存在一个交叉点，可以选择这两个条件以达成合理的折中。从这个值增加管径可能会产生更有效的放电，但由于自吸收，总效率下降。减小管径可以实现更好的光提取，但由于电流密度增加，光效仍然下降。低功率钠灯在0.6安培的放电电流下运行，对于SOX版本，选择了大约12毫米内径的管作为最佳选择。高功率灯在0.9安培下运行，这些灯采用16毫米直径的放电管。在SOX-E系列中，通过在相同管径下以0.3-0.45安培运行低功率灯，以及在相同较大口径管中以0.6安培运行高功率灯，获得了额外的效率。尽管效率大幅提高，但由于相同尺寸管中的功率负载较低，光通量下降。",
						"在20世纪50年代，BTH Mazda的一些非常创新的思维带来了一个激进的钠放电管设计新概念，即采用具有非圆形横截面的管。从圆形管转向具有更大表面积与体积比的设计，可以在使用大直径管的同时显著增强钠光传输，而大直径管则提供低电流密度。考虑并测试了几十种放电管几何形状，其中许多制造难度极大，仅作为实验室样品存在。\n\t\t到1959年，AEI Mazda完成了其开发，线性钠灯投放市场。第一个产品是200瓦的灯，提供20000流明，这是照明史上一个非常重要的里程碑，因为这是第一个突破每瓦100流明障碍的商业光源。其他额定功率为250瓦、150瓦和100瓦的型号很快也问世了。这些灯的核心是一个交替的月牙形横截面的放电管，这种形状可以相对容易地模制成放电管玻璃——图S32展示了其横截面视图。一组模具同时压入加热的玻璃管的一侧，然后将玻璃管旋转180度，相同的模具压入玻璃的另一侧，形成这种特殊的凹痕形状。交替在管的两侧开槽的主要原因是确保灯的每一侧的光度学光分布是对称的。一个额外的好处是，它将放电长度增加了大约10%，因此可以从更短的灯中产生更多的光。这种放电管形状的概念源自PowerGroove线性荧光灯管，当时美国通用电气正在开发这种灯管，通用电气与其子公司BTH之间的全面合作解释了它们许多灯和生产技术设计的相似性。",
						"1959年，欧司朗-通用电气也涉足线性钠灯的制造，采用的设计主要基于Mazda灯。德国欧司朗也生产了这种灯，但由于在本土市场销售这种光源不成功（在本土市场，白色汞灯更受欢迎），很快便停止生产。SLI灯的效率如此之高，以至于当时AEI Mazda决定停止生产旧的U形设计，将全部精力集中在线性钠技术上。这种情况持续了十多年，直到公司被Thorn Lighting接管，并建立了一条新的SOX生产线。",
						"线性钠灯最初采用一体式设计，将放电管密封在一个一件式的抽真空外罩中。一个或两个玻璃套管包围内管，与SOI一体式灯一样，用于最小化热辐射损失。线性等效产品很快采用了它们自己的名称SLI，以区分它们是线性产品。\n\t\t1965年，欧司朗-通用电气在提高线性钠灯效率方面取得了第二次重大突破。该公司成功地消除了玻璃隔热套管，并用溅射在外罩内侧的金薄膜取而代之，这提供了更好的热绝缘效果。在玻璃上留下了两条清晰的条纹，这些未涂层部分与放电管辐射最多光的两侧对齐，以在不严重影响热绝缘的情况下最大化光传输效率。欧司朗的新产品在几年内以“金色线性”系列的名义销售，有60瓦和175瓦两种规格。这些产品使用与AEI-Mazda 60瓦和200瓦版本相同的控制装置，但功率消耗略有降低，以获得相同的光通量。德国欧司朗采用效率稍低的铋膜，并提供了一种更强大且尺寸更大的220瓦灯。\n\t\t1964年，飞利浦推出了具有大幅改进涂层的U形钠灯，该涂层由氧化锡组成。这种半导体材料提供了出色的红外反射，但光吸收极小，SOX型红外涂层灯就是在这个时候推出的。SLI产品很快采用了这种新材料。\n\t\t到1967-68年，随着铟锡氧化物材料的使用，红外涂层再次得到改进，提供了更高的效率。随着这种涂层的引入，SOX灯被重新额定为较低的功率。唯一采用铟膜的SLI灯是Thorn Lighting（AEI Mazda的继承者）推出的一种新的140瓦产品。140瓦SLI灯设计为在90瓦SOX镇流器上运行，具有令人难以置信的每瓦142流明的效率。其余的SLI系列继续使用氧化锡涂层。与SOX灯一样，氧化锡和氧化铟涂层的SLI产品可以通过玻璃表面反射的颜色来区分——氧化锡灯呈黄色，氧化铟灯呈绿色。",
						"1966年，Thorn Lighting（AEI Mazda的继承者）在SLI生产上进行了大量投资，并进行了一些改进，试图对抗当时日益流行的SOX灯，该公司当时尚未生产这种灯。最重要的是，该公司投资购买了自动玻璃吹制车床，能够将放电管制成20世纪50年代测试过的一些非常复杂的形状，但当时制造成本过高。Thorn的新灯放弃了简单的月牙形凹槽管，转而采用具有四叶草风格横截面的灯，这种横截面具有非常大的表面积与体积比。在“叶子”的顶端模制了八十八个小脊，这些凹痕因其形状而被亲切地称为“温室”，作为钠保留库。1980年，通过引入更复杂的五叶草管和新的200瓦高输出灯，效率得到了进一步提高。图S33展示了四叶草管的横截面。",
						"在改变形状后不久，稀有气体填充也进行了修改，以优化性能。添加了0.05%的氙气，允许降低氩气浓度，由于氙气不会被钠灯中使用的硼酸盐玻璃吸收，因此延长了气体寿命。然而，更重要的是，氙气允许将总气体填充压力降低到更低水平。由于活性放电与稀有气体之间的弹性碰撞和非弹性碰撞减少，实现了相应的效率提高。然而，如果没有引入新的电极设计，灯的寿命将会缩短，因为较低的气体压力会导致电极上的发射涂层损失率增加。图S34展示了旧式和新式灯中稀有气体放电颜色的差异。上面看到的是以前使用的特征性红色氖 - 氩颜色，而下面的微弱紫色放电是改进后的氖 - 氩 - 氙混合物。",
						"钠灯的电极传统上采用三重卷绕的钨丝，浸入发射剂中，并使发射剂填充线圈之间的空间。在这种设计中，发射剂可能会因路灯服务中发现的低频强烈振动而机械脱落，或者在正常灯运行期间被溅射和蒸发掉。作为公司在荧光灯改进阴极方面工作的一个分支，开发了一种全新的钠电极，称为编织阴极。利用从纺织业借来的机器，将七或八根细钨丝编织成一个空心管。然后将管本身卷绕形成电极。在发射剂浸渍阶段，这种化学物质被完全吸入编织管内，每个给定尺寸和额定值的阴极可以容纳更多的发射剂。因此，灯的寿命可以大大提高。编织阴极使公司立即将其整个荧光灯系列的寿命翻倍，其在线性钠技术中的应用帮助使新的四叶草风格灯比以往任何时候都更耐用。图S35展示了编织阴极的高倍放大视图。",
						"除了是第一个实际超过每瓦100流明的灯外，线性钠灯在照明史上还保持着另一项记录。它是第一个用于高速公路照明的光源——直到1971年，只有城市中心街道和主要干线道路被照明。然而在那一年，第一个高速公路照明装置投入使用，包括伦敦和卢顿之间的M1高速公路上的1200个Thorn 140瓦SLI/H灯。这些灯在AEI的Amberline SLI灯具中运行，后来被称为Thorn Lighting的Alpha Five灯具。\n\t\t在结束线性钠灯部分之前，值得注意的是，欧司朗-通用电气在其位于温布利的赫斯特研究中心进行了许多关于具有类似非圆形横截面的陶瓷弧管的高压钠灯的实验。这里的主要目标不是提高放电效率，而是提供不对称的光辐射，以更好地适应路灯光学。一些设计非常复杂，甚至在陶瓷放电管本身模制了透镜和菲涅尔图案。尽管结果令人鼓舞，但当时的生产成本过高。1975年，S.A. Rigden在美国专利3,885,181中披露了全部细节。"

						"尽管前面提到的高压灯具比最初的低压开发产品带来了许多优势，但在早期，这两种类型的灯具的一个显著缺点是操作它们所需的电气控制设备的复杂性。除了简单的限流任务以控制放电电流外，还需要提供点燃放电的手段。\n\t\t在20世纪30年代初，德国欧司朗开发了第三种低压钠灯，试图克服这一限制。该概念基于高压风格，并增加了特殊功能，以便可以在普通市电电压下启动放电。这极大地简化了电气装置，允许使用普通的扼流圈式镇流器，就像越来越受欢迎的汞蒸气灯一样。\n\t\t这种自启动灯具由欧司朗和飞利浦生产，但其商业成功（或缺乏）的事实是，两家公司在几年后都停止了其生产。部分原因是其效率并不高，还因为这是一种生产成本较高的灯具。与此同时，控制设备的发展使得自耦漏抗式变压器的成本和复杂性降低，这种变压器后来成为高压钠灯操作的常见设备。尽管如此，自启动灯具的构造在技术上很有趣，但记录较少，因此将在本节中详细描述。",
						"自启动灯具的点火电压通过结合以下四个设计特点中的至少前两个，降低到低于市电电压。在某些灯具类型中，也可能采用第三和/或第四个机制：\n\t\t\n\t\t\t与标准高压灯具相比，放电管的直径增加，长度减少。这两个特点都导致了更低的启动电压，但由于放电的电流密度高于最佳水平，带来了效率降低的缺点。\n\t\t\t在放电管内沿其大部分长度（通常在靠近一个或两个电极处有一个短间隙，有时也在放电管的中心）布置一条或两条玻璃套隔离导线。在灯具启动前，市电的全部电压都施加在这些间隙上，由于距离较短，放电管内的稀有气体填充可以在相对较低的电压下被电离。这些导线并联了一个高串联电阻，以便在电离发生后，放电转移到主电极上。\n\t\t\t在主电极之一的附近可能提供一个辅助电极，并通过第二个高电阻连接到放电管另一端的电极。其工作原理与汞蒸气灯中的探针电极相同。\n\t\t\t最后，一个或多个主电极可能在灯具启动前被预热，以便通过热电子发射释放电子。\n\t\t\n\t自启动低压钠灯以两种不同的形式开发：双端和单端。每种类型在以下页面中都有更详细的描述。"

						"自启动钠灯最初以这种双端格式开发，据信起源于1931年欧司朗柏林实验室。它们有两种版本，第一个被称为Na300-56W。几年后，又推出了Na600-100W变体。第一个数字指的是光通量，以德卡尔门为单位，按照德国赫夫纳流明尺度计算，这与当今的国际流明略有不同。1赫夫纳流明 = 0.903流明。因此，其光通量分别为3000和6000赫夫纳流明，相当于大约2700和5400流明。第二个数字指的是功率消耗，分别为56瓦和100瓦。它们仅由欧司朗生产，据信在1940年之前停产。图S36展示了一个典型示例。",
						"值得注意的是，尽管大多数低压钠灯的开发是为了实现最大光效，但这些早期的线性光源似乎是为了在高表面亮度下产生最大光通量而优化的。这一点从图S38可以看出，该图显示了Na300-56W系统的特性随市电电压变化的情况。很明显，在220-260伏的典型市电电压范围内，这种灯具的光通量最大，而光效最优的点则在更低的市电电压下才能达到。",
						"低光效是放电长度相对较短的自然结果，这导致了较高的放电电流密度。短放电的另一个副作用是灯具电压相当低，这意味着镇流器中会消耗更多的功率，从而降低了系统的光效。双端灯具的另一个缺点是它们依赖于电极的预热，这使得控制设备相当复杂。另一个弱点是镇流器提供的低预热电流需要采用相当脆弱结构的电极，据推测其使用寿命可能不如其他钠灯中使用的重型电极。",
						"由于光源直径小且亮度高（约14斯蒂布），可以实现良好的光学控制。其首次应用是在1931年8月，用于欧司朗柏林建筑内院的泛光照明。在20世纪30年代中期，欧司朗在德国、奥地利、意大利、挪威、瑞典和芬兰进行了一系列更广泛的路灯试验。图S39展示了1934年德国科隆和波恩之间一段道路上的典型安装，灯具悬挂在路灯上。",
						"在两种尺寸的灯具中，放电管都是由一段宽口径短管制成。它包含一条隔离导线，大部分长度被包裹在一个小直径玻璃管内。有时管内的导线呈细螺旋钨丝形状，尚不清楚这是否在加热方面起到进一步降低灯具点火电压的作用。在管的中点附近有一个小孔，以便在灯具生产过程中抽空内部空间。从管的两端延伸出探针，靠近放电管两端的主电极。当灯具首次通电时，这些点会引发一个小放电。隔离导线在放电管内处于电气悬浮状态。\n\t\t主电极由一根弯曲成简单U形的钨丝组成。它们涂有通常的氧化物发射混合物，能够通过放电本身被加热到热电子发射温度，但也提供了预热以降低点火电压。在最早的安装中，标准做法是两个电极都进行预热，但后来发现对于较短的Na300-56W灯具，仅预热一个电极就足够了。在垂直操作时，建议预热下部阴极。点火后，阴极由放电的热量保持在正确温度。\n\t\t放电管的热绝缘是通过将其安装在一个大直径的外灯泡中实现的，该灯泡被抽成高真空。通过一个覆盖放电管整个长度的二次玻璃套管，进一步改善了绝缘效果。它的作用与现代SOI/H型灯具相同，将长波长红外辐射反射回内部放电管。放电管通过位于套管和外灯泡之间的环形凹陷处的螺旋弹簧支撑在套管内，通常套管和外灯泡都提供这些凹陷。\n\t\t两种灯具尺寸都配备了大型双插脚灯头，每个电极的一侧连接一个端子。这种四针配置允许对电极进行必要的预热。\n\t\t图S40展示了线性自启动灯具的构造，这两种灯具除了长度和直径不同外，其他方面完全相同。",
						"为了更好地理解线性自启动灯具的点火过程，图S41展示了Na300-56W和Na600-100W变体的典型接线方式。请注意，以虚线显示的第二个预热变压器及其相关接线仅对较大的灯具是必要的。\n\t\t\t当市电电压施加到扼流圈的输入端子上时，灯具的放电空间尚未导电，因此没有电流流动。然而，电极预热变压器与灯具并联连接，因此镇流器的电流反而流经它们的初级绕组。预热变压器的输出端提供大约5伏的低电压，导致1.5安的电流流经灯具电极。达到热电子发射温度后，电极附近的气体填充被电离，并促进了向放电管内玻璃套管内的探针的击穿。由于放电的电阻可以忽略不计，它随后绕过了内部启动导线，并有效地短路了外部变压器，切断了提供给电极的预热电流。顺便说一下，镇流器本身是一种隔离式的扼流圈，这是为了防止高频振荡注入市电供应。可以提供一个额定值为0.1微法拉的电容器，以进一步减少射频干扰。"

						"为了克服线性自启动钠灯的诸多限制，并更好地与飞利浦开发的单端高压灯竞争，欧司朗于1936年推出了一款单端自启动灯系列。它们分为两种型号，分别为Na300U-53W和Na500U-80W。第一个数字表示光通量，单位是德卡尔门，按照德国赫夫纳流明量度，这与当今的国际流明略有不同。1赫夫纳流明 = 0.903流明。因此，它们的光通量分别为3000和5000赫夫纳流明，相当于大约2700和4500流明。第二个数字表示功率消耗，分别为53W和80W。字母U将它们与线性版本区分开来，因为它们采用了U形放电管。\n\t\t这两种单端灯也由飞利浦埃因霍温制造，名称略有不同，分别为SO300和SO500。据信，欧司朗和飞利浦都在1940年之前停产了这两种灯，因为到那时已经清楚，高压灯是更好的设计。图S37和S42展示了采用两种启动辅助装置的Na500U-80W灯的结构。Na300U-53W与之相同，只是省略了启动探针和次级电阻。",
						"在这两种规格中，放电管都被弯成一个短U形弯，由宽口径管制成。放电管的每一肢都包含一根隔离的导线，其大部分长度被封装在小口径玻璃管内。有时管内的导线呈细卷钨丝形式，尚不清楚它是否起到任何加热作用，以进一步降低灯的启动电压。管子在其中点附近有一个小孔，以便在灯的生产过程中抽空内部空间。从每根管的远端延伸出探针，进入U形弯区域，两者之间大约有一厘米的间隙，这形成了灯启动时首次激发放电的一对位置之一。这些隔离导线中的一根通过压封中的第三根导体引出放电管，并通过高电阻连接到管另一端的电极。电阻位于放电管两肢之间的云母支撑盘中心。第二根隔离导线悬浮在放电管的第二肢内，其近端距离主电极几毫米。这个间隙形成了灯启动时激发小放电的第二个位置。\n\t\t在500赫夫纳流明灯的情况下，放电管的一端还密封了一个第三辅助电极，并与一个主电极并排放置。它通过灯外罩内的第二个电阻连接到对面的主电极。这个第二电阻比第一个大得多，呈卷绕电阻丝的形式，包裹在C形陶瓷管内，安装在云母盘的周边。\n\t\t主灯电极的结构与现代低压钠灯相似，但由单根轴向钨丝线圈组成，而不是现在的三重卷绕蜂窝形线圈。它们涂有常规的碳酸钡 - 锶 - 钙发射混合物，并由放电本身加热到热发射温度。灯启动前没有预热装置。它们的引线通过压封密封在放电管的两端，并包裹一层耐钠硼酸盐玻璃，用小氧化镁陶瓷管封顶，以防止液态钠接触玻璃 - 金属界面。\n\t\t放电管的热绝缘是通过将其密封在大口径抽空外罩内实现的。通过一个覆盖放电管大部分长度的椭圆形截面玻璃管来提高绝缘效果。它与更现代的SOI/H型灯的功能相同，用于将长波长红外辐射反射回内部放电管。它仅在一端通过与外罩顶部熔合来支撑。在未被次级玻璃管覆盖的U形弯区域的外表面涂有一层铂金漆，以在该区域提供额外的热反射。\n\t\t采用钡型吸气剂来维持灯寿命期间外罩内的高真空度，特别值得一提的是这种吸气剂的结构，这无疑是这种装置在电灯中的首次应用之一。现代钡吸气剂由压入U形镍镀钢支撑件的钡 - 铝合金组成，它们通过射频感应加热来触发放热反应，蒸发钡。然而，在这些早期钠灯中，吸气剂是通过电加热的。合金被认为是一种钡 - 镁 - 铝粉末，装入小口径陶瓷管内。在管子周围缠绕一圈钨丝或钼丝，灯外罩的灯脚中还提供两根额外的引线。这些允许吸气剂通过电加热以蒸发其钡荷载。此后，灯脚中的两根导线变得多余，剩下的两根连接到灯头。\n\t\t两种灯尺寸都配备了E40 / GES哥利亚爱迪生螺口，其形状异常，采用纯铜而非通常的黄铜材料制成。这可能是因为其大直径裙边用于连接玻璃灯泡，更容易在更易延展的金属中成型。鉴于所有启动装置都包含在放电管及其外罩内，灯头只需要两个电接触点。",
						"当将市电电压施加到灯端子上时，对于500赫夫纳流明灯，会发生以下一系列事件。300赫夫纳流明变体的情况相同，只是由于该设计省略了启动探针，因此步骤1不会发生。该过程在图S43中以图形方式展示。\n\t\t\n\t\t\t放电最容易在辅助探针电极与其中一个主电极相邻的位置激发。这使气体填充物电离，并产生少量光，从而降低了其周围气体的电离势。由于第一个电阻的值很高，放电电流被限制在非常低的值。\n\t\t\t由于第一个电阻的值极大，放电迅速转移到更容易在该放电管肢的这个主电极与附近的隔离导线末端之间击穿的路径上。为了完成电路，在放电管的U形弯区域的间隙处也发生了击穿。由于第二个电阻的值较低，放电电流在这一阶段后能够有所增加。目前尚不清楚在这一阶段，隔离管内的钨丝是否产生了任何加热效应，这可能在降低击穿电压方面发挥了进一步的作用。\n\t\t\t此时，U形弯和其中一个主电极附近都存在小放电，气体填充物变得足够导电，以至于在两个主电极之间直接激发了放电，当然，其电流当然被设置主灯电流的外部扼流圈限制在更高的值。"
